abstract = {During the cultivation and processing of coffee different residues can be obtained, such as, coffee cut-stems, coffee silverskin, spent coffee grounds, coffee pulp, and coffee husk. In the last years, some research has demonstrated that this type of biomass can be a good source of bioproducts through its transformation using stand-alone processes or biorefineries. In this sense, this chapter shows a description of coffee grain and an overview of the world production, consumption, and processing stages to obtain the by-products. In order to know the potential and identify the important compounds in the coffee processing, the physicochemical composition of by-products is analyzed. Thus, an analysis of possibilities of integral valorization of by-products as raw materials to obtain antioxidants, biofuels, bioenergy, bioproducts, and biofertilizers is performed. Finally, the biorefinery concept is considered to generate biochemicals and added-value products from the abovementioned residues, taking into account the design of biorefineries, the production scale, and a technical and economic assessment.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CSS) has various nutritional and functional properties, enabling it for valuable applications. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an efficient and economic extraction technique. In this research, UAE was employed in the extraction of bioactive compounds from CSS with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent. Extraction efficacy between the UAE-treated extracts and the UAE-untreated (control) was assessed in terms of the total phenolic content (TPC), caffeine content, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), and antioxidant capacities. The yields of TPC were in the range from 5.80 ± 0.06 to 8.94 ± 0.01 mg GAE/g sample. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity were highly enhanced by applying UAE compared to the controls. Noticeable caffeine content in the range from 3.27 ± 0.10 to 4.29 ± 0.01 g/100 g sample was found in the CSS samples. CGAs (3-CGA, 4-CGA, and 5-CGA) were all quantified. Methanol–water extracts showed significantly (p {\textless}.05) higher TPC, caffeine content, and antioxidant capacity than water extracts. The micro-structure investigation of CSS indicated UAE can cause cell disruption and micro cracks so that it can be an effective extraction technique. Peleg's model showed a good fitting (R2 {\textgreater} 0.94) to the experimental results on the kinetics of UAE of phenolics compounds. Practical applications: Coffee is a most consumed beverage internationally. Due to its great production, large quantities of residues including coffee pulp and husk, coffee silver skin, and spent coffee grounds are generated in the coffee industry. Among them, coffee silverskin (CSS) is a by-product during the coffee roasting process, which contains nutritional and functional properties. As an efficient and economic novel extraction technique, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed in the current study to extract bioactive compounds from coffee silverskin with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent in order to overcome various disadvantages encountered by the conventional extraction methods. Results indicated that application of UAE pretreatment showed significantly higher recovery of phenolic compounds compared to the controls and high ultrasound intensity (38 W/cm2) was more effective in recovering polyphenols compared to 5 W/cm2 ultrasonic treatments. Therefore, results from the current study provide useful and practical information for the coffee industry.},

For this purpose, we have reviewed the literature on the composition and safety of coffee flowers, leaves, pulp, husk, parchment, green coffee, silver skin, and spent coffee grounds. Some of these products have a history of consumption in Europe (green coffee), while others have already been used as traditional food in non-EU-member countries (coffee leaves, notification currently pending), or an application for authorization as novel food has already been submitted (husks, flour from spent coffee grounds). For the other products, toxicity and/or safety data appear to be lacking, necessitating further studies to fulfill the requirements of novel food applications.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin is the major by-product of coffee roasting. Among all the coffee by-products, it is a relatively stable product due to its low moisture content. Currently, silverskin is used as direct fuel (e.g. firelighters), for composting and soil fertilization. As it is a natural source of several bioactive compounds that can be extracted and further used for food or dermocosmetic purposes, the valorization of this by-product is of utmost importance, having in view the sustainability and circular economy principles. The aim of this work was to evaluate, for the first time, the influence of different geographical origins (Brazil, Uganda, Vietnam, Cameroon, Indonesia, and India) on the chemical composition of silverskin obtained from Coffea canephora beans. Different parameters were analysed, including ashes, protein, soluble and insoluble fiber, and total lipid amounts; vitamin E, fatty acid and phenolics profiles (by HPLC-DAD-FLD, GC-FID, and HPLC-DAD, respectively); caffeine, 5 caffeoylquinic acid and hydroxymethyfurfural contents (by HPLC-DAD); and antioxidant profile (total phenolics and flavonoids contents, DPPH center dot inhibition, and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power). Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were found between the samples, especially regarding the fatty acid profile and the antioxidant composition. For instance, the Brazilian silverskin was the richest in total lipids and vitamin E, while the Indian silverskin was the poorest in phenolics and antioxidant activity, and presented a higher relative percentage of saturated fatty acids. A Principal ComponentAnalysis allowed to group the studied samples according to their geographical proximity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CSS) is the only by-product from the coffee roasting process. This waste is generated on a large scale and most of it is disposed of as industrial waste. However, the rich composition of CSS in products such as phenolics, indicate its potential use as a source of chemicals. In this work, CSS pyrolysis oils and biochars have been studied within biorefinery concept in order to transform the coffee waste into energy and chemical source. Taking into account the effect of temperature on biochar and pyrolysis oil properties, CSS was pyrolysed at 280 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C. The resulting biochars presented significant calorific values, indicating its potential use as energy source for the coffee roasting process. GC-MS analysis showed that pyrolysis oils were mainly composed of caffeine, acetic acid, amino compounds and phenolics, the latter being the most important products due to their antioxidant properties. Antioxidant capacity of the samples were measured through Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH methods, showing an increase of phenolics in pyrolysis oils compared to CSS, mainly in 280 °C sample. Therefore, pyrolysis at 280 °C would allow the valorisation of CSS, coming closer towards circular economy and bioeconomy in the coffee industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.},

abstract = {Promoting circularity in the aquaculture sector through the conversion of great amount of organic by-products produced on land is a valuable strategy for a further development of the aquaculture sector. In this regard, insects represent a very promising example of bio-converting organisms; their application in aquafeeds, however, still faces possible limitations because of their lack in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the presence of chitin. The aim of the present study was to apply circularity to Black Soldier Fly (BSF) (Hermetia illucens) culture and to improve the insect's biomass fatty acid composition by culturing them on a land-produced by-product (coffee silverskin) enriched with a 10{\%} Schizochytrium sp. The insect biomass was then used to formulate five fish diets containing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100{\%} of insect meal respect to fish meal, respectively. Diets were used for a feeding trial during zebrafish (Danio rerio) larval development (21 days) and a multidisciplinary approach including biometry, histology, gas chromatography, spectroscopy (FTIR), microbiota analyses and molecular biology was applied to better understand fish responses to the new diets. Results showed that the 50{\%} substitution of fish meal with insect meal represented the best compromise between ingredient sustainability and proper fish growth and welfare. Fish fed with higher BSF inclusions (75 and 100{\%}) showed a severe degree of hepatic steatosis, microbiota modification, a higher lipid content (FTIR), fatty acid modification and higher expression of both stress and immune response markers.},

In particular, coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the main coffee industry residues. CS is about 4.2{\%} (w/w) of coffee beans and the valorisation of this waste through the biorefinery approach may boost the circular economy development. In the present contribution, CS was pretreated with one of the mainly investigated biomass pretreatment reported in literature: alkaline hydrolysis in NaOH solutions. After enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated CS, the obtained sugars were used as carbon source to produce butanol and isopropanol by Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423. Moreover, fermentation tests were also carried out with synthetic media to investigate the effects of the alkaline pretreatment on the fermentation process. When pretreated CS was used as feedstock, the largest yields were 0.16 and 0.31 gsolvent/gsugars isopropanol and butanol, respectively. The reported results foster further studies regarding the reuse of CS for solvents production through fermentation processes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract = {Context: Coffee silverskin (CS), a food by-product of the coffee roasting industry, has been studied as an active ingredient for skin care products due to its high potential of antioxidant activity and low cytotoxicity. Another food waste used as ingredient with promising characteristics is obtained from Medicago sativa (MS), which antioxidants and isoflavones content is high. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate and characterize a new body formulation containing two food by-products extracts. Materials and methods: Different parameters (such as pH, rheological behavior, color, antioxidant content and microbiological analysis) of a body cream formulation containing by-products (CSMS) and a formulation without extracts (F) were evaluated under a stability study during 180 days at different temperatures. Moreover, the in vitro cell toxicity and the in vivo skin safety and protective effects were also assessed. Results: Formulation showed stable physical properties and antioxidant activity during 180 days of storage. In vitro toxicity was screened in two skin cell lines (fibroblasts and keratinocytes) and any toxicity was reported. The in vivo test carried out showed that, with respect to irritant effects, CSMS formulation can be regarded as safe for topical application and the skin hydratation improved after 30 days of its use. Also, considering the consumer acceptance, more than 90{\%} of volunteers classified it as very pleasant. Conclusions: CSMS formulation is stable and safe for topical use as no adverse and/or side effects were observed during the application period of testing, improving skin protective properties.},

The inclusion of antioxidants in topical formulations can contribute to minimize oxidative stress in the skin, which has been associated with aging. Also, questions of sustainability are leading to the study of new cosmetic ingredients obtained from food by-products. Coffee Silverskin (CS) is a food by-product with established antioxidant activity that has not yet been incorporated into a topical formulation.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical and microbiological stabilities and antioxidant activity of a hand cream formulation containing 2.5{\%} (w/w) of CS extract upon production and after 6 months of shelf-life and in vitro safety/cytotoxicity on skin cell lines after production.Materials and methods: The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated with MTS and LDH assays, at different concentrations, in HaCaT and HFF-1 cells. Formulations were stored at 25 degrees C/65{\%} RH and 40 degrees C/75{\%} RH. Physical, microbiological, and antioxidant stabilities were evaluated by centrifugation, viscosity, total colony count, DPPH and total phenolic content (TPC).Results: The hand cream containing 2.5{\%} (w/w) of CS extract showed stable physical characteristics independently of the storage conditions. The DPPH activity and TPC of the CS formulation were significantly higher compared with those of the base formulation. However, during storage, the antioxidant activity decreases slightly. Microbiological quality was also confirmed. No cytotoxic effects were observed.Conclusion: It is possible to suggest that this formulation is stable under extreme conditions and safe for topical use.},

abstract = {Coffee bean tegument (silverskin) is a by-product derived from the coffee roasting process. This residue has been discarded, which constitutes a serious environmental problem. The depletion of oil reserves and environmental issues promoted by the combustion of fossil fuels has generated interest in the use of biomass to obtain fuel and chemicals products. The liquid product obtained by biomass pyrolysis is commonly called bio-oil. Bio-oil is a complex mixture of compounds, and its detailed chemical characterization is necessary to prospect its potential uses. Therefore, this study optimized the final temperature of pyrolysis and N-2 flow rate parameters for the pyrolysis of silverskin in a fixed bed reactor, by using a central composite design and response surface. The bio-oil chemical composition was evaluated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to rapid-scanning quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC x GC/qMS), combined with the use of standards and linear temperature-programmed retention indices (LTPRI). The optimal values. calculated were 560 degrees C for the final pyrolysis temperature and 49 mL min(-1) for the N-2 flow rate. The organic phase yield was 15.2{\%} under these conditions. At the optimal conditions, 228 compounds were identified (90.1{\%} of the sample chromatographic volume) in the organic phase. The major chemical class, in terms of volume percentage, were the phenols (26.70{\%}), followed by nitrogen compounds (18.51{\%}). In addition, it is worth mentioning the high represent ability of the saturated hydrocarbons (8.28{\%}), unsaturated aliphatic (6.69{\%}), and aromatics (7.77{\%}), which together account for 22.74{\%} of the sample chromatographic volume. These results showed that the silverskin bio-oil may have the potential use as a source of chemical inputs.},

Coffee silverskin (CS) is the only by-product produced during the coffee beans roasting process, and large amounts of CS are produced by roasters in coffee-consuming countries. However, methods for the effective utilization of CS have not been developed. Reuse of CS, which is the primary residue from the coffee industry, is important for the environment and economy. Recently, there have been some attempts to reuse CS for biological materials and as a nutrient source for solid-state fermentation. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview about CS, its chemical composition, biological activity, and attempts at its reuse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin, the major coffee-roasting by-product, is currently used as fuel and for soil fertilization. However, there are several studies reporting silverskin as a good source of bioactive compounds that can be extracted and further used by cosmetic industry. Its high antioxidant potential may be due to the synergistic interaction of chlorogenic acids (1-6{\%}), caffeine (0.8-1.25{\%}), and melanoidins (17-23{\%}), among other antioxidant compounds. The bioactive compounds of silverskin can answer to the new fields of cosmetic industry on natural active ingredient resources that improve health skin appearance, counteract skin aging and related diseases, in an environmentally friendly approach. Skin aging is a complex process associated with oxidative metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. ROS production increase matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as well as pro-inflammatory mediators, resulting in consequent skin damage and aging. To counteract this process, cosmetic industry is looking for compounds able to increase MMP inhibitory activities, hyaluronidase inhibitory activity, expression of collagen and elastase inhibitory activity, as potential bioactive ingredients with anti-aging purposes. This review focuses on skin aging factors and the potential anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-cellulite and anti-hair loss activity, as well as protection against UV damage, of coffee silverskin and their bioactive compounds. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are important pests of numerous agricultural crops especially vegetables, able to cause remarkable yield losses correlated to soil nematode population densities at sowing or transplant. The concern on environmental risks, stemming from the use of chemical pesticides acting as nematicides, compels to their replacement with more sustainable pest control strategies. To verify the effect of aqueous extracts of the agro-industry waste coffee silverskin (CS) and brewers' spent grain (BSG) on the widespread root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, and on the physiology of tomato plants, a pot experiment was carried out in a glasshouse at 25 +/- 2 degrees C. The possible phytotoxicity of CS and BSG extracts was assessed on garden cress seeds. Tomato plants (landrace of Apulia Region) were transplanted in an artificial nematode infested soil with an initial population density of 3.17 eggs and juveniles/mL soil. CS and BSG were applied at rates of 50 and 100 {\%} (1L/pot). Untreated and Fenamiphos EC 240 (nematicide) (0.01 mu L a.i./mL soil) treated plants were used as controls. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chlorophyll content of tomato plants were estimated during the experiment. CS extract, at both doses, significantly reduced nematode population in comparison to the untreated control, although it was less effective than Fenamiphos. BSG extract did not reduce final nematode population compared to the control. Ten days after the first treatment, CS 100 {\%}, BSG 50 {\%} and BSG 100{\%} elicited the highest ROS values, which considerably affected the growth of tomato plants in comparison to the untreated plants. The control of these pests is meeting with difficulties because of the current national and international regulations in force, which are limiting the use of synthetic nematicides. Therefore, CS extracts could assume economic relevance, as alternative products to be used in sustainable strategies for nematode management.},

abstract = {Background: Coffee silverskin, a by-product from coffee roasting industries, was evaluated as a feedstock for biobutanol production by acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation. This lignocellulosic biomass contained approximately 30{\%} total carbohydrates and 30{\%} lignin. Coffee silverskin was subjected to autohydrolysis at 170 °C during 20 min, with a biomass-to-solvent ratio of 20{\%}, and a subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial enzymes in order to release simple sugars. The fermentability of the hydrolysate was assessed with four solventogenic strains from the genus Clostridium. In addition, fermentation conditions were optimised via response surface methodology to improve butanol concentration in the final broth. Results: The coffee silverskin hydrolysate contained 34.39 ± 2.61 g/L total sugars, which represents a sugar recovery of 34 ± 3{\%}. It was verified that this hydrolysate was fermentable without the need of any detoxification method and that C. beijerinckii CECT 508 was the most efficient strain for butanol production, attaining final values of 4.14 ± 0.21 g/L acetone, 7.02 ± 0.27 g/L butanol and 0.25 ± 0.01 g/L ethanol, consuming 76.5 ± 0.8{\%} sugars and reaching a butanol yield of 0.269 ± 0.008 gB/gS under optimal conditions. Conclusions: Coffee silverskin could be an adequate feedstock for butanol production in biorefineries. When working with complex matrices like lignocellulosic biomass, it is essential to select an adequate bacterial strain and to optimize its fermentation conditions (such as pH, temperature or CaCO3 concentration).[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

Coffee silver skin (CSS), potato peel (PP) and brewer's spent grain (BSG) are voluminous by-products in their respective processing industries. The present study compared these three by-products for their prospective utilization in producing polyphenols-rich aqueous extracts by using ultrasound-assisted extractions (UAE). A probe-type sonicator was used for ultrasound treatments. The total phenolic contents in the extracts were assessed by Folin-Ciocalteu assay, while the phenolic profiles of the extract was characterized by LC-Q-TOF mass spectrometry. The microstructure of the samples after UAE was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ultrasound treatment enhanced the rate of extraction and recovered 2.79, 2.12 and 0.66 mg gallic acid equivalents/g of TPC from CSS, PP and BSG, respectively in 30 min, which correspond to recoveries of 97.6{\%}, 84.5{\%} and 84.6{\%}, respectively, compared to conventional solid-liquid extractions carried out for 24 h. The extraction yield was dependent on the particle size of the raw materials and the highest yield was obtained from the materials with 100-250 mu m particle size. The SEM imaging revealed that ultrasound treatment caused prominent tissue damage. Extracts contained mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of phenolic acids. PP and CSS had the highest amounts of umami free amino acids (0.13 mg/g in each), while BSG contained the highest amount of essential amino acids (92 mg/g). The present work shows that CSS, PP and BSG are good sources of polyphenols and UAE can be employed to enhance the extraction efficiency as means of a green approach.},

The new formulation combines well-known and novel food ingredients. To validate the novel ingredients, we determined the physicochemical characterization, caffeine and chlorogenic acid contents, and food safety of coffee silverskin (CSE) and husk (CHE) extracts. Sensory and nutritional quality, bioactive compounds (chlorogenic acid, total phenolic compounds, melanoidins and browning), in vitro bioaccessibility, and health-promoting properties (overall antioxidant capacity and alpha-glucosidase activity) of the breads were evaluated as well. Results support the feasibility of CSE and CHE as natural sustainable sources of antioxidants, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and colorants. The observed health-promoting properties suggest that coffee by-product extracts could potentially be used as functional food ingredients or supplements to reduce the risk of chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress and to control postprandial glucose levels. Based on consumers' preferences, we obtained new bread formulations with a high nutritional and sensorial quality, suitable for celiacs and with the potential to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disease related to oxidative stress. Data on in vitro digestion indicated a significant (p{\textless}0.05) decrease in the bioaccessibility of sugars and a significant increase (p{\textless}0.05) in antioxidants.},

abstract = {The research of value-added applications for coffee silverskin (CSS) requires studies to investigate potential bioactive compounds and biological activities in CSS extracts. In this study, different ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) methods have been tested to extract bioactive compounds from CSS. The obtained extracts, were characterized using a new HPLC-MS/MS method to detect and quantify 30 bioactive compounds of 2 classes: alkaloids and polyphenols (including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and secoiridoids). CSS extracts obtained with ethanol/water (70:30) as extraction solvent showed the highest levels (p {\textless}= 0.05) of bioactive compounds (4.01 +/- 0.34{\%} w/w). High content of caffeine was observed with levels varying from 1.00{\%} to 3.59{\%} of dry weight of extract (dw). 18 phenolic compounds were detected in CSS extracts with caffeoylquinic acids (3-CQA, 5-CQA and 3,5-diCQA) as the most abundant polyphenols (3115.6 mu g g to -5444.0 mu g g(-1)). This study is also one of the first to characterize in-depth flavonoids in CSS revealing the levels of different flavonoids compounds such as rutin (1.63-8.70 mu g g(-1)), quercetin (1.53-2.46 mu g g(-1)), kaempferol (0.76-1.66 mu g g(-1)) and quercitrin (0.15-0.51 mu g g(-1)). Neuroprotective activity of silverskin extracts against H2O2-induced damage was evaluated for the first time suggesting for methanol and ethanol/water (70:30) extracts a potential role as protective agents against neurodegeneration due to their ability to counteract oxidative stress and maintain cell viability. Silverskin extracts were not inhibiting the growth of anyone of the bacterial species included in this study but data obtained by water extract might deserve a deeper future investigation on biofilm-related activities, such as quorum sensing or virulence factors' expression. From their composition and their evidenced biological activities, CSS extracts could represent valuable ingredients in nutraceutical formulations.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CS), the main by-product in the coffee industry, contains a vast number of human health-related compounds, which may justify its exploitation as a functional food ingredient. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the polyphenolic and alkaloid profile through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis. The bioaccessibility of total phenolic compounds and changes in the antioxidant activity during an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were also evaluated through spectrophotometric tests (TPC by Folin-Ciocalteu, ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP), to elucidate their efficacy for future applications in the nutraceutical industry. Caffeoylquinic and feruloylquinic acids were the most representative polyphenols, with a mean concentration of 5.93 and 4.25 mg/g, respectively. Results showed a high content of caffeine in the analyzed CS extracts, with a mean value of 31.2 mg/g, meaning a two-fold increase when compared to coffee brews. Our findings highlighted that both the bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity of CS polyphenols significantly increased in each in vitro gastrointestinal digestion stage. In addition, the colon stage might constitute the main biological site of action of these antioxidant compounds. These results suggest that in vivo, the dietary polyphenols from CS might be metabolized by human colonic microflora, generating metabolites with a greater antioxidant activity, increasing their well-known beneficial effects.},

abstract = {Coffee roasting industries generate a by-product called coffee silverskin that is usually disposed of as waste. The valorization of this abundant waste is necessary because of the antioxidant compounds in coffee silverskin. In this study, coffee silverskin was extracted in different extraction conditions to obtain an extract with high antioxidant activity and to use it as an additive for antioxidant skin gel. The extracts were characterized for the total phenolic content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The antioxidant activity was determined by using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. It was found that the extraction time and temperature strongly affected the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the extracts. The extraction at 40 degrees C and 60 min resulted in an extract with a high total phenolic content of 31.15 +/- 2.77 mg Gallic Acid Equivalent/g coffee silverskin and a high antioxidant activity of 68.44 +/- 0.76{\%}. The extract solution was spray-dried to produce extract powder, which was then added to a basic skin gel with different extract concentrations. It was observed that the antioxidant activity of the gel increased with increasing extract concentration in the gel. This result showed that coffee silverskin has great potential as a source of antioxidants for various skin care products.},

abstract = {Nowadays, coffee beans are almost exclusively used for the preparation of the beverage. The sustainability of coffee production can be achieved introducing new applications for the valorization of coffee by-products. Coffee silverskin is the by-product generated during roasting, and because of its powerful antioxidant capacity, coffee silverskin aqueous extract (CSE) may be used for other applications, such as antiaging cosmetics and dermaceutics. This study aims to contribute to the coffee sector's sustainability through the application of CSE to preserve skin health. Preclinical data regarding the antiaging properties of CSE employing human keratinocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans are collected during the present study. Accelerated aging was induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) in HaCaT cells and by ultraviolet radiation C (UVC) in C. elegans. Results suggest that the tested concentrations of coffee extracts were not cytotoxic, and CSE 1 mg/mL gave resistance to skin cells when oxidative damage was induced by t-BOOH. On the other hand, nematodes treated with CSE (1 mg/mL) showed a significant increased longevity compared to those cultured on a standard diet. In conclusion, our results support the antiaging properties of the CSE and its great potential for improving skin health due to its antioxidant character associated with phenols among other bioactive compounds present in the botanical material.},

abstract = {The evaluation of by-products to be added to food products is complex, as the residues must be analyzed to demonstrate their potential use as safe foods, as well as to propose the appropriate process and product for recycling. Since coffee is a very popular beverage worldwide, the coffee industry is responsible for generating large amounts of by-products, which include the coffee silverskin (CS), the only by-product of the roasting process. In this work, its characterization and food safety were evaluated by chemical composition assays, microbiological determinations, aflatoxin measurements and acute toxicity tests. The results showed that CS is safe for use in food, in addition to providing dietary fiber, protein and bioactive compounds. An extruded cereal-based ready-to-eat food product was developed through an extreme vertices mixture design, producing an extruded food product being a source of protein and with a high fiber content. Up to 15{\%} of CS was incorporated in the extruded product. This work contributes to the establishment of routes for the valorization of CS; nevertheless, further research is necessary to demonstrate the sustainability of this food industry by-product.},

abstract = {The present study focused on the application of pulsed electric fields (PEF) as an innovative pre-treatment technique to improve the recovery of polyphenols from two food by-products, cocoa bean shell (CBS) and coffee silver skin (CS). The effect of the different operating parameters on the extraction of polyphenols was optimised using the response surface methodology statistical approach. The optimised methodology was compared with conventional extraction and applied to several CBS and CS samples to classify the samples according to origin, variety and industrial treatment. PEF-assisted extraction had higher (approximately 20{\%}) recovery yields of polyphenols and methylxanthines than conventional extraction. Finally, the results highlighted that the composition of bioactive compounds from different extracts of CBS and CS and their antioxidant properties depended on the origin, variety and industrial processing of the raw material. These by-products may be a promising source of natural compounds, with potential applications on food and health sectors.},

abstract = {Context: Currently, there is a great tendency in cosmetic area to use natural extracts. Coffee silverskin (CS) is the most abundant solid by-product generated during roasting of coffee processing. Objectives: To evaluate different CS extracts as promising cosmetic ingredients, regarding antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic properties. Materials and methods: Aqueous, hydroalcoholic and ethanolic CS extracts were obtained by an environmentally friendly procedure considering costs and pollution. Extracts were characterized for total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC, respectively), antioxidant activity by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), antimicrobial activity expressed as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and cytotoxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl )-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays in two skin cell lines (fibroblasts and keratinocytes). Results: The TPC of extracts was 18.33-35.25 mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of material on a dry basis (mg GAE/g db). The TFC of extracts was 1.08-2.47 mu g cathechin equivalents per g dry material (mu g CE/g db). The antioxidant activity was high, with values ranging between 95.95 and 216.40 mu mol Fe2+/g for aqueous and alcoholic samples, respectively. Preliminary assays for antimicrobial potential showed that extracts display antibacterial activity. The MIC varied from 31.3 to 250 mu g/mL for Gram-positive, and from 31.3 to 1000 mu g/mL for Gram-negative. Extracts did not affect in vitro cell viability, with values near 100{\%} in all concentrations tested. Conclusion: Results seem show that CS is a safe source of natural antioxidants with antifungal and antibacterial activity and no cytotoxicity, with potential usefulness for cosmetic applications.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin is a major roasting by-product that could be valued as a source of antioxidant compounds. The effect of the major variables (solvent polarity, temperature and extraction time) affecting the extraction yields of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of silverskin extracts was evaluated. The extracts composition varied significantly with the extraction conditions used. A factorial experimental design showed that the use of a hydroalcoholic solvent (50{\%}:50{\%}) at 40 degrees C for 60 minis a sustainable option to maximize the extraction yield of bioactive compounds and the antioxidant capacity of extracts. Using this set of conditions it was possible to obtain extracts containing total phenolics (302.5+/-7.1 mg GAE/L), tannins (0.43+/-0.06 mg TAE/L), and flavonoids (83.0 +/- 1.4 mg ECE/L), exhibiting DPPH center dot scavenging activity (326.0+/-5.7 mg TE/L) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (1791.9+/-126.3 mg SFE/L).

On the other hand, considering that life expectancy has increased in developed countries, raising new concerns about skin and body appearance, the demand for cosmetics with natural ingredients is stronger than ever, representing a challenge for the worldwide economy and society. This chapter revises the potential application of bioactive compounds from coffee by-products to active ingredients for skin-care products.
