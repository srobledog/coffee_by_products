abstract={The aim of this paper is to review and study a new approach for improving strains of Aspergillus niger specially adapted to produce pectinases by Solid State Fermentation (SSF) with materials having low levels of water activity (aw), i.e., coffee pulp. Special emphasis is placed on the use of two antimetabolic compounds: 2-deoxy-glucose (DG) and 2,4-dinitro-phenol (DNP) combined with a water depressant (ethylene glycol = EG) in order to put strong selection pressures on UV treated spores from parental strain C28B25 isolated from a coffee plantation. Such a strain was found to be DG sensitive. Results suggested the existence of a reciprocal relation between adaptation of isolated strains to SSF or to Submerged Fermentation (SmF) systems. Preliminary physiological analysis of isolated strains showed that at least some few initially DG resistant mutants could revert to DG sensitive phenotype but conserving increased pectinase production. Also it was found that phenotype for DNP resistance could be associated to changes of DG resistance. Finally, it was found that low levels of aw produced by adding 15% EG to agar plates, were a significant selection factor for strains well adapted to SSF system. © 1993.},

abstract={Dried coffee pulp (DCP) was investigated for its nutritional quality. Chemical analyses of the pulp indicated its overall nutritional value to be low. The crude protein, fat, ash and metabolisable energy contents were 79.7 g kg-1 DM, 13.4 g kg-1 DM, 67.2 g kg-1 DM and 5.38 MJ kg-1 DM, respectively. It contained high amounts of fibre and anti-nutrients such as tannins and caffeine. In a subsequent feeding trial, 255 commercial broiler chicks were randomly allocated to one of 5 dietary treatments. The dietary treatments consisted of the control diet, which contained maize as the main cereal source, and 4 other diets which contained varying levels of DCP (25, 50, 75 and 100 g kg-1). Food and water were provided ad libitum for a period of 8 weeks. In this study, food intake and weight gain were both significantly and inversely related with the level of DCP in the diet (r = -0.96 and -0.87, respectively). The level of DCP in the diet was also shown to be strongly correlated with food conversion ratio (r = 0.88) and with water consumption (r = 0.98). All the carcass traits measured, with the exception of dressing percentage, were similar. There were however, no health-related problems nor mortalities attributable to level of DCP in the diet. DCP could be included in broiler chicken diets at concentrations up to only 25 g kg-1 diet without an adverse effect on performance. © 1988.},

abstract={Two samples of spent coffee grounds were examined in the laboratory, using sheep to determine their potential as a ruminant feed. Analyses showed a high cell wall content (74-77% DM). In vivo digestibility coefficients for organic matter (0·22·0·48) were rather low and coefficients for gross energy were very low (0·02·0·17). The very low digestible energy (0·5·4·3 MJ kg-1 DM) and negative metabolisable energy contents indicate that coffee grounds are worthless as a ruminant feed. © 1986.},
