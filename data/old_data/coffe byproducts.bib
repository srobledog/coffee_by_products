abstract = {The world consumption of coffee generates large amounts of by-products. However, the use of these wastes for animal feed has not been possible due to the presence of antiphysiological and antinutritional factors, such as tannins and caffeine. Nevertheless, coffee silverskin (CS), spent coffee grounds (SCGs), coffee husks, and immature/ defective coffee beans, the industrial by-products of coffee processing, have a potential use in skin-care formulations, based on their high content of bioactive compounds. On the other hand, considering that life expectancy has increased in developed countries, raising new concerns about skin and body appearance, the demand for cosmetics with natural ingredients is stronger than ever, representing a challenge for the worldwide economy and society. This chapter revises the potential application of bioactive compounds from coffee by-products to active ingredients for skin-care products. Their potential UV protective action, emollient capacity, antiwrinkle, and antimicrobial activities are critically reviewed and discussed.},

In the last years, some research has demonstrated that this type of biomass can be a good source of bioproducts through its transformation using stand-alone processes or biorefineries. In this sense, this chapter shows a description of coffee grain and an overview of the world production, consumption, and processing stages to obtain the by-products. In order to know the potential and identify the important compounds in the coffee processing, the physicochemical composition of by-products is analyzed. Thus, an analysis of possibilities of integral valorization of by-products as raw materials to obtain antioxidants, biofuels, bioenergy, bioproducts, and biofertilizers is performed. Finally, the biorefinery concept is considered to generate biochemicals and added-value products from the abovementioned residues, taking into account the design of biorefineries, the production scale, and a technical and economic assessment.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of replacing oat hay with coffee husk for the feeding of confined lambs. In this study, 24 male Texel lambs of approximately 60 days of age and with a mean +/- standard error weight of 21.95 +/- 5.81 kg were examined. Their diet was composed of 30{\%} oat hay and 70{\%} concentrated feed per kilogram of dry matter. The experimental design was randomized and included four treatments (0, 7.5, 15, and 22.5{\%} of coffee husk in the total dry matter), with six replicates of each treatment. The animals were slaughtered when they reached a mean live weight of 32 kg. There was no significant difference in dry matter intake and mean daily weight gain (which were 197 g day(-1)) among treatments. The mean daily weight gain (DWG) was not significantly affected (P {\textgreater} 0.05) by the replacement of oat hay with coffee husk in the diet, with the overall mean DWG being 215.05 g day(-1). There were no significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) among treatments in any of the studied carcass variables, and the mean true carcass yield was 53.9{\%}. The lambs presented a mean finishing score of 2.96 (on a scale of 1 to 5) and a conformation of 4.21 (on a scale of 1 to 6), characterizing them as good carcasses. In terms of economic viability, the 7.5{\%} diet stood out as the one that had the highest profitability, generating a profit of {\$} 3.25 USD per kg of carcass produced. Coffee husk can therefore replace oat hay in the feed of finishing lambs in concentrations of 0.075 to 0.225 kg kg-(1) of total dry matter with biological and economical efficacy and generating good commercial carcasses.},

abstract = {Coffee husk and coffee pulp are coffee processing by-products. Coffee husk is obtained when harvested coffee is processed by the dry method, and coffee pulp is produced by the wet method. In Brazil, coffee is usually processed by the dry method, therefore an expressive amount of husk is obtained every year. Some of the husk is used as organic fertilizer but, other applications are very limited, mainly because it is a bulky product. The presence of tannins and caffeine diminish acceptability and palatability of husk by animals. This review discuss degradation of caffeine by microorganisms, with special attention to bacterial, biological decaffeination of coffee husk and pulp and its subsequent use on animal feeding. The known biochemical routes of caffeine degradation by microorganisms are initially discussed; problems concerning physiological effects in animals, focusing on the limitations imposed by caffeine as an antiphysiological component are raised; the use of microorganisms to decaffeinate coffee husk and pulp is discussed. The discussions offer a view on decreasing caffeine content of coffee husk and pulp, which would allow the use of larger amounts of these products in animal feeding, partially replacing traditional components such as cereal grains. {\textcopyright} 2002, Scientia Agricola.

In the recent years, because of the fast-growing food companies and production, food processing by-products have gained a lot of interest and attracted many technical and health professionals as well as policy makers internally and internationally. Also, concerns are increasing about food by-products due to their ecological and environmental impact on the planet. This is particularly of concern when large companies emit. Large quantities of food by-products are thrown into environment in which they can be exploited technically, medicinally, and pharmaceutically. This is due to their chemical component and biologically active compounds of the by-products. Therefore, this systematic review focuses on the food by-product biological compounds present in different parts of the food products, particularly in some common foods such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, dairy products, meat, eggs, nuts, coffee, and tea. Moreover, the review also explains the kind of biologically active compounds and their quantity not just in edible foods, but also in part and types of the by-product which then can be reused and recycled into different processes in order to extract and get benefit from.},

The use of waste such as the coffee husk for food production is limited due to the presence of antinutritional components (tannins and caffeine) and high-fiber content. The production of edible mushrooms using coffee husks is an option for recovering this byproduct because of the fungi's ability to degrade these compounds and convert the lignocellulosic residues to food with high commercial and nutritional value. Moreover, with the use of these fungi, this byproduct can also be used to enrich mushrooms with selenium or other minerals important for human health and to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes or animal feed. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The scientific evidence which has proved the harm of this alkaloid has paved the way for innumerable research in the area of caffeine degradation. In addition to this, the fact that the by-products of the coffee and tea industry pollute the environment has called for the need of decaffeinating coffee and tea industry's by-products. Though physical and chemical methods for decaffeination are available, the lack of specificity for removal of caffeine in these techniques and their non-eco-friendly nature has opened the area of microbial and enzymatic degradation of caffeine. Another important application of microbial caffeine degradation apart from its advantages like specificity, eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness is the fact that this process will enable the production of industrially and medically useful components of the caffeine degradation pathway like theobromine and theophylline.

abstract = {Introduction: Total coffee production in the world in 2013 was 8.7 million Mg of coffee beans. Coffee must be processed after harvest to separate beans from the husk, and the post-harvest process can generate different types of residues. Knowing that 50 {\%} of the harvested coffee is husk, it is important to consider that these by-products can contribute to environmental problems if not disposed of properly. There is a need to find alternatives to the piling of coffee husk as a means of disposal at coffee farms. The objectives in this experiment were to characterize five types of coffee processing residues and assess their value as potassium (K) fertilizer by examining K release. Results: Chemical characteristics of coffee residues varied with processing method, such as wet and dry processes. Application of residues to soil columns followed by 40 weeks of simulated leaching increased total K content in the soil for all treatments based on application rate, except for enriched and three-year composted coffee husk (3ycomp). Coffee processing residues had higher concentrations of K leached compared with the control with no K application, but only 3ycomp was higher than other coffee processing residues. Total K released from coffee residues increased linearly with application rate, but the decomposition of the coffee residues was low, which suggest that K release from coffee processing residues is not related to decomposition. Conclusion: Post-harvest coffee processes impacted concentrations of K, nitrogen, carbon, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, phenol, pH, and electrical conductivity among the coffee processing residues. The K release was high (over 90 {\%}), but it did not depend on the type of coffee processing residue, and thus, the residues can be a substitute for a mineral source of K applied to soils. The use of coffee processing residues as source of K did not prevent K losses by leaching. Some coffee residues resulted in greater K leaching than mineral KCl applied at the same rate. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

The Province of Santiago de Cuba in southeast Cuba was the focus of this study; its existing operations, infrastructure, resource flows and scarcities, and actor relationships provide the basis of the data used for the evaluation. The authors investigated the regional context, identify potential members of an agricultural and agro-industrial network in three municipalities of the province, and identify the main residuals and by-products of key facilities. Potential avenues for by-product valorization are investigated along with the possible influence/impacts on the sustainability of the surrounding systems and actors. A conceptual model for a regional network for integrated food and energy production is then provided based upon the development of three agricultural/ agro-industrial scenarios: influence at the farm level, regional agro- industrial networks, and `anchor tenant' eco-industrial systems. The main challenges and opportunities for the development of the networks are described with recommendations for addressing such where possible.},

The first group was held in a conventional system with a compact floor. The second group was kept on a compact floor covered with coffee pods. The experimental period was 60 days. Levels of caffeine and chlorogenic acid in the insemination doses (ID) before and after 96 h of storage at 15 degrees C and the reproductive performance (litter size and rate of return to estrus) of these doses after their utilization in a standard artificial insemination protocol were evaluated. The ID from the animals kept in pens containing the coffee pods contained 25.4 +/- 8.7 mu g/mL of caffeine, whereas no significant amounts of chlorogenic acid were detected. Semen from boars housed with coffee husk showed a significant increase in malondialdehyde levels, which indicates a significant increase in cell membrane peroxidation, after 96 h of storage. There were no significant differences in the other evaluated semen quality parameters when analyzed among groups. Likewise, there was no significant influence of coffee hulls on either the rate of return to estrus or the litter size of inseminated females. The use of coffee husks as floor covering worsens the quality of fresh semen and that of insemination doses stored for 96 h but not the quality of semen immediately diluted; therefore, coffee husks may be used only on farms that use semen immediately processed after collection without affecting the reproductive parameters of breeding stock.},

abstract = {Agro-industrial processing always generates waste materials. Coffee is one of the largest commodities in the world, and its processing yields coffee husk as waste by-product. Its disposal without proper treatment can cause serious environmental problems. Coffee husk contains carbohydrates including fermentable sugars, polyphenols such as tannins, lipids. Various microorganisms including filamentous fungi are reported to grow on it despite the presence of antimicrobial compounds. Chemical nature of coffee husk makes it a suitable and inexpensive source for solid-state fermentation. Several studies have been reported on the application of coffee husk in bioprocess. It acts as a substrate as well as carbon source during fermentation. Production of various enzymes such as xylanases, cellulases, polygalacturonases, polyphenol oxidases, tannases in high titers can be achieved by fermentation using coffee husk as substrate. Apart from production of enzymes, bioconversion of coffee husk is also achieved during bioprocess which in turn favors sustainable utilization of waste products. Production of citric acid, gibberellic acid, gallic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and bacterial cellulose is reported by fermentation using coffee husk as substrate. Mass production of microorganisms is another advantage of using coffee husk in bioprocess. It is excellent for the growth of various biocontrol agents such as Trichoderma sp. Besides economic production, prolonged shelf life of biocontrol agents multiplied on coffee husk makes it more attractive. Biopesticides such as Bacillus sphaericus and B. thuringiensis can also be produced by solid-state fermentation on coffee husk. The sustainable management of agro-industrial waste like coffee husk through bioprocess makes it as an attractive source of wealth.},

abstract = {Exoglucanase was produced using coffee husk, the by-product of coffee processing industries, as the sole carbon source using economical fermentation strategies like solid-state fermentation (SSF). The effects of process parameters such as pH, moisture and fermentation duration on exoglucanase synthesis was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) based on three factors and five level central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Statistical analysis revealed moisture and fermentation duration has significant effect on the exoglucanase production. The optimized conditions were pH 6.7, moisture 43.2{\%} and fermentation duration 99.8 hours. At these conditions, the predicted exoglucanase activity was 392.2 U/ml and the actual experimental value was 390.3 U/ml. The experimental value (390.3 U/ml) related well with the predicted one (392.2 U/ml) indicating the suitability of the model employed. The enzyme showed optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 40°C. The enzyme activity was enhanced in presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+. The effect of solvents and detergents on the enzyme activity was also studied. The results indicate excellent scope of utilizing coffee husk as solid substrate for commercial production of exoglucanase employing Rhizopus stolonifer.

abstract = {Data about coffee consumed world-wide are somewhat contradictory. A conservative estimate, suggests a number of around 8 mln tones per year. Its production involves a comparable amount of by-products, mainly pulp, husks, skins and spent coffee grounds. Thus, a sustainable coffee industry requires the development of methods for utilization of coffee by-products. Among these, the preparation of renewable fuel additives (e.g. biodiesel) and carbon adsorbents is a promising alternative to the eventual dumping of biogenic substances, harmful to the environment. Extraction of coffee by-products is the first step towards their utilization. This work presents results on laboratory extraction of spent coffee grounds (SCG) with different solvents, discussed in the context of the preparation of renewable fuel additives. The aim of the present study is to develop a procedure for extraction of coffee residues, suitable for production of biofuels and adsorbents.},

Model validations at optimum operating conditions showed excellent agreement between the experimental results and the predicted responses with a confidence level of 95 {\%}. Endoglucanase thus produced was utilized for ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and maximum of 65.5 g/L of ethanol was obtained. This fungal cellulase has also reported to be efficient detergent additives and promising for commercial use. The present study demonstrates coffee husk as a significant bioprocess substrate. Statistical optimization with major parameters for cellulase production can be highly applicable for industrial scale. Furthermore, value addition to coffee husk with sustainable waste management leading to environment conservation can be achieved.},

abstract = {The tradition in Colombia of processing coffee in each farm provides a source of residual biomass (coffee pulp) with a potential for transformation into synthesis gas through the process of biomass gasification, since 40{\%} of the weight of the harvested coffee is fresh pulp. The conceptual design, construction and commissioning of a downstream biomass gasifier was carried out with the aim of using coffee pulp as the source of biomass as it is readily available on all coffee farms. During the operation of the gasifier, the process gives rise to a combustible gas and biochar. The latter can be used for soil amelioration, in the coffee plantation, as well as being a means of sequestering atmospheric carbon. After the process of mechanical separation, the coffee pulp was submitted to solar drying after which it presented a uniform particle size, between 2 and 3 mm, ideal for use in fixed bed gasifiers. In this study, the coffee pulp was compared with two other sources of biomass; rice hulls and “cisco” (the outer skin of the coffee bean available from coffee processing factories. While the gasifier operates, the fuel gas is thermally harnessed through a heat exchanger, which heats the air stream to a constant temperature of 50 °C. The hot air is supplied to a traditional coffee dryer, where the coffee grains are dried to 12{\%} humidity for further packaging and marketing. It was evident during the tests that the gasifier needed a stabilization time to obtain a stream of stable and combustible synthesis gas. The dried coffee pulp produced a synthesis gas of more uniform quality as compared with the rice husks and the coffee husks. The time to stabilise the gas flow and the rate of consumption of biomass also favoured the use of coffee pulp compared with the other feedstocks. By contrast, the relative production rate of biochar was higher for rice husk compared with coffee pulp and cisco” which did not differ. The quality of the biochar, as indicated by its capacity to absorb water was also highest for the rice husk biochar. The coffee pulp was associated with a minimum degree of obstruction of the pipes by tar, in contrast to the coffee husks that produced more tar. Biochar contamination of the synthesis gas stream was also apparent when the fuel was rice husks or coffee husks due to their lower density compared to the coffee pulp. {\textcopyright} 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

After coffee processing only 5.8{\%} of the total matter is used for coffee production generating a large amount of waste, were no commercial value, that can hardly pollute the environment. The coffee husk conservation can be made by silage. Specific microorganisms can produce a standard ensilage when added in the process. The main goal of this work is to study the natural microflora present in the coffee husk and coffee pulp able to ensilage these by-products. The lactic acid bacteria responsible for this process were isolated and characterised and added in an ensilage process to accelerate the acid lactic production. First, in this work, fresh fruity coffee pulp were put fermented naturally and it was observed that the pH was maintained around 4 during two months. Then many bacteria were isolated from these natural fermented materials. Morphology, fermentative and biochemistry studies were used to identify and characterise the bacteria. These bacteria were able to grown in a coffee extract and change the pH 6 to around 4.4. Then, the second study was added these isolated bacteria in processed coffee husk to ensilage. It shows that is necessary to add the lactic acid bacteria to initiate the ensilage process. In the coffee husk fermentation, 10(7) CFU were added per g of matter and the pH was maintained around 4.8; microorganisms were viable for 2 months.},

abstract = {This review provides a general overview of the suitability of different agro-industrial wastes for enzyme immobilization. For the purposes of this literary study, the support materials are divided into two main groups, called lignocellulosic (coconut fiber, corn cob, spent grain, spent coffee, husk, husk ash, and straw rice, soybean and wheat bran) and not lignocellulosic by-products (eggshell and eggshell membranes). The study pointed out that all of these wastes are materials of great potentiality for enzyme immobilization even if coconut fiber is preferred. This result is of significant interest due to the low cost and great availability of such wastes, which actually are underused and cause significant environmental problems for improper storage. In addition, the development of economic biocatalysts more sustainable, besides reduce environmental impacts, improve the application of enzymatic technology in industry. Therefore, the enzyme immobilization reaction and the application of biocatalysts are reviewed and discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose In this study, the composting and co-composting potential of coffee husk and pulp with source-separated municipal solid waste (SSMSW) was investigated. Methods Coffee husk and pulp were mixed independently with SSMSW in different proportions (0, 33, 50 and 100{\%}), and composted in triplicates with a total of 24 composting piles for 3 months. From each compost type, different physicochemical parameters were analyzed. In addition, the seed germination, growth and fresh head weight yield of each compost type were investigated on each matured compost type using cabbage seed (Brassica oleracea). Results The results indicate that the two coffee by-products can be composted alone or co-composted with SSMSW yielding very mature and stable compost. The results indicated that the addition of 1/4th of local soil (wt/wt) on C8 compost type yields the optimum fresh head weight of the cabbage among all field experiments. In addition, when C8 compost type is mixed with local soil in 3:1 ratio, it could yield an optimum fresh head weight of the cabbage (572 +/- 10 g/kg of compost). This could be due to the relatively higher concentration of total nitrogen in the C8 compost sample. Conclusions Generally, the final compost can be served for unrestricted type of agricultural purposes. Thus, co-composing of coffee husk and pulp with SSMSW can alleviate the multidimensional problems of rural and urban dwellers.},

abstract = {Biochar is the carbonaceous solid byproduct from thermal treatment of biomass that is produced specifically for application to soils. Studies have shown that when biochar is added to soils, it is able to increase yields, improve soil properties, and effectively store carbon for hundreds to thousands of years. This study compared the performance of biochar from five different feedstocks (coffee husks, maize cobs, eucalyptus wood, groundnut shells, and rice husks) produced in a traditional kiln and biochar from two different feedstocks (maize cobs and eucalyptus wood) produced in a downdraft gasifier. This research, conducted at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, was aimed at investigating the potential of biochar as a soil amendment in the humid tropics. Biochar samples were combined with undisturbed soil in a 45-day pot experiment to compare effects on maize growth. On average, soils amended with gasifier-produced biochar had higher yields than the unamended soil and soils amended with kiln-produced biochar. Comparing kiln-produced chars from different feedstocks, the coffee husk chars were the most productive. Results indicated that the soluble ash content of the biochar had the greatest influence on soil productivity. Ugandan soils, like most soils in the humid tropics, are strongly acidic (pH = 4.7), and the increase in pH caused by the soluble ash in the biochar provided for more favorable growing conditions and higher nutrient availability.

A good example is the use of a great variety of agricultural crop residues and agroindustrial by-products as substrates in the production of edible mushrooms. Mushroom cultivation is an efficient biotechnological process, since high performances and good productivity are achieved with low environmental controls. Mushrooms grow in a wide range of temperature, in short periods and has the ability of biodegrade different lignocellulosic substrates. This makes possible the valorization of agricultural, forest and agroindustrial residues regionally available. In Mexico, mushroom cultivation is an important economic and ecological activity, because it generates employments and enables the use and recycling of more than 500,000 tons of agricultural, agroindustrial and forest residues, per year. Moreover, it reduces the environmental impact of the final disposition of green residues. The goal of this work is to present a review of the research, mainly in Ibero-American countries, about the utilization of different green wastes (substrates) on the cultivation and production of edible mushrooms (Pleurotus spp.). Substrates were classified as straw, stubble, pulp, bagasse, forest residues, and others. The wide variation of biological efficiency (BE) (15 {\%} - 235 {\%}) obtained in different studies, and the criteria needed to choose the correct substrate for the cultivation of mushrooms were also analyzed.},

abstract = {In response to increasing waste production and commodities prices, greater attention is being paid to the utilization of waste streams as a source for raw materials and energy. Researchers have developed technologically and economically viable alternate end-of-life (EOL) strategies for a number of formerly landfilled byproducts. One in particular, spent coffee grounds (SCG), has shown promise in a wide variety of applications including ethanol production, biodiesel production and anaerobic digestion. However, no research has been done to assess the environmental impacts of these scenarios. The study looked at the 18 ReCiPe 2008 midpoint indicators and as well as the cumulative energy demand and found that the production of biodiesel, ethanol and glycerin from spent coffee grounds actually had a negative effect on the amount of CO2 eq produced and the energy demanded. While the methodology is customized to the conditions at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the methodology can be applied to other campuses, cities or municipalities with alterations based on the consideration of local conditions and resources. {\textcopyright} 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

OOD and FAB were exploited for the first time as alternative substrates for PHA production. UCO, OOD and FAB were used by Cupriavidus necator and Pseudomonas oleovorans to synthesize the homopolymer poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, while Pseudomonas resinovorans and Pseudomonas citronellolis produced mcl-PHA polymers mainly composed of hydroxyoctanoate and hydroxydecanoate monomers. The highest polymer content in the biomass was obtained for C. necator (62 wt.{\%}) cultivated on OOD. Relatively high mcl-PHA content (28-31 wt.{\%}) was reached by P. resinovorans cultivated in OOD. This study shows, for the first time, that OOD is a promising substrate for PHA production since it gives high polymer yields and allows for the synthesis of different polymers (scl- or mcl-PHA) by selection of the adequate strains.},

Six different media were prepared including 100{\%} conventional media, 100{\%} sand, 10{\%} SCG + 90{\%} sand, 20{\%} SCG + 80{\%} sand, 30{\%} SCG + 70{\%}, sand and 100{\%} SCG. While GP is 90{\%} in the media where the SCG ratio is 10{\%}, GP values decrease to 50{\%} as the SCG ratio increases. The greatest seedling height values were found in conventional media (14.4 cm), followed by the seedlings in 100{\%} sand with 11.4 cm and 20{\%} SCG + 80{\%} sand with 11.1 cm. The highest root collar diameter was found in 20{\%} SCG + 80{\%} sand with 3.9 mm. The highest root/shoot ratio (0.7) was obtained in 10{\%} SCG + 90{\%} sand. Total seedling biomass was the greatest in conventional media (2.1 g). As SCG increased in the media, N, K, Mg, and P concentrations increased, and Ca concentration and C/N ratio decreased in all seedling components (needle, main root, lateral root, and stem). Results point to the possibility of using a small amount of SCG to alter seed germination, seedling characteristics, and nutrient uptake for production of containerized stone pine seedlings.},

abstract = {The spent coffee ground is a by-product of the coffee industry with high potential because of its beneficial properties for health, however, due to high water content, it is necessary to stabilize it without affecting bioactive capacities. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different convective drying conditions, on some technological and functional properties of the spent coffee ground and to determine the thermal degradation kinetics of chlorogenic acids. The methodology included the optimization of the drying process conditions of spent coffee ground: temperature (40-60 degrees C), air flow (1.0-2.0 m/s) and cake thickness (0.01-0.02 m). Effective diffusion coefficient, moisture, water activity, water and oil holding capacity, antioxidant capacity, caffeine, and seven chlorogenic acids were determined. The results showed that the best drying conditions were 60 degrees C, 2.0 m/s, 1.28 cm which allows retaining 84.24{\%} of total polyphenols and 66.00{\%} of the antioxidant capacity. Chlorogenic acids showed thermal degradation kinetics of first order under the optimal process conditions. In general, it is concluded that the convective drying process is a valid technique for processing of coffee grounds, as it allows the preservation of antioxidant compounds with a potentially beneficial effect on health, providing a stabilized low moisture content that can be used in food applications.

abstract = {Coffee is the second largest traded commodity after petroleum and the second most popular beverage after water. This big industry is believed to generate huge amount of waste with spent coffee grounds (SCGs) represents one of the main by-products. Recycling of such waste to fuels and value-added products through bio-refineries is a promising way to solve the problem of many countries that face daily challenges and heavy cost in waste disposal. This review aims to shadow the light on SCGs recycling potential in which over 230 published papers on SCGs recycling topic were gathered and discussed. Various opportunities to produce biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, bio-oil and fuel pellets besides value-added products such as bioactive compounds, adsorbents, polymers, nanocomposites, and compost were discussed. Moreover, the potential of membrane technology related to various processes of biorefining, separation and purification in the proposed SCG-integrated biorefinery are presented. Based on the presented review, it is obvious that recycling of SCGs offers many worthwhile options to policymakers that can contribute towards huge financial saving on taxpayers of running and maintaining landfills besides saving the environment from harmful emissions. In conclusion, this review emphasizes that SCG-integrated biorefineries to produce different types of biofuels and value-added products are a very promising approach that shall be economically more scrutinized in the foreseen future.},

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative application for spent coffee grounds (SCGs) used as filler for the formulation of lightweight clay ceramic aggregates (LWA). LWA can be used for urban and agricultural purposes as a sustainable solution. Spent coffee grounds were tested as a pore forming agent partially acting as a replacement for red clay in material formulation before firing. Substitutions of 10, 15, and 20 wt.{\%} of red clay were tested. The properties of lightweight aggregates with 15 wt.{\%} of SCGs were improved using a specifically tailored fertilizer glass due to its low pH and conductivity within the soil tolerance range. Packaging glassy sand, cattle-bone flour ash, and potassium carbonate were mixed and melted in order to obtain this glass, which when added to the clayey batch functionalized the aggregates by phosphorus and potassium nutrients. The results (in particular, porosity and bulk density) show that the lightweight aggregates obtained have interesting properties for possible uses both in urban (e.g., green roofs as a drainage layer) and agricultural purposes. Moreover, pH and conductivity are in line with the Italian Standard regarding soil amendment (D.lgs. 75/2010). In addition, several leaching tests were performed in a solution containing 2 vol.{\%} citric acid (C6H8O7) to evaluate the release capacity not only of nutrients (P and K) but also to check the presence and release of heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), that may come from the glassy precursor. The results obtained showed that nutrients are efficiently released in 21 days (P = 87.73{\%} and K = 25.74{\%} of released percentage) and Pb release is under the standard threshold of 30 ppm.},

abstract = {Biodiesel is a renewable energy source produced from natural oils and fats, and is being used as a substitute for petroleum diesel. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and its by-products to produce pelletized fuel, which is expected to help the biodiesel production process achieve zero waste. For this experiment, spent coffee grounds sample was collected from Kaldis coffee, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Extraction of the spent coffee grounds oil was then conducted using n-hexane, ether and mixture of isopropanol to hexane ratio (50:50 {\%}vol), and resulted in oil yield of 15.6, 17.5 and 21.5 {\%}w/w respectively. A two-step process was used in biodiesel production with conversion of about 82 {\%}w/w. The biodiesel quality parameters were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751). The major fatty acid compositions found by Gas chromatography were linoleic acid (37.6{\%}), palmitic acid (39.8{\%}), oleic (11.7{\%}), and stearic acid (8.6{\%}). In addition, solid waste remaining after oil extraction and glycerin ratio (glycerin content from 20-40{\%}) was evaluated for fuel pellet (19.3-21.6 MJ/Kg) applications. Therefore, the results of this work could offer a new perspective to the production of biofuel from waste materials without growing plants and/or converting food to fuel. {\textcopyright} 2014 BRTeam.},

abstract = {Background: Because of the important role of bioactive compounds in functional foods and health care, more and more attention has been paid to the active components extracted by green extraction methods. However, how to ensure the extraction yield and biological activity during the extraction process is an urgent problem to be solved. Subcritical water extraction (SWE) is a promising engineering method, which provides an environmentally friendly technology for extracting various bioactive compounds from natural products. Especially, under high temperature and high pressure, subcritical water can change the polarity and dielectric constant of solvents, thus contributing to a better extraction process, improving the mass transfer efficiency of the extracts and maintaining its biological activities, which has a high application prospect. Scope and approach: This review provided an update overview on the fundamental principles and bioactive compounds extraction with subcritical water. This will contribute to deepen the understanding of SWE and provide theoretical basis and reference value for further improving the application of subcritical water. Key founds and conclusions: It is expected that this green and efficient extraction technology will be increasingly applied in the extraction of more bioactive ingredients in the near future. In addition, future research should consider combining SWE with other physical extraction techniques to ensure the retention of the biological ingredients better. These active compounds with SWE have great potential in health care medicine and functional foods. Meanwhile, future researches should focus on consumer acceptability, safety, legal aspects, and commercial availability of health products.},

The valorization of this abundant waste is necessary because of the antioxidant compounds in coffee silverskin. In this study, coffee silverskin was extracted in different extraction conditions to obtain an extract with high antioxidant activity and to use it as an additive for antioxidant skin gel. The extracts were characterized for the total phenolic content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The antioxidant activity was determined by using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. It was found that the extraction time and temperature strongly affected the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the extracts. The extraction at 40 degrees C and 60 min resulted in an extract with a high total phenolic content of 31.15 +/- 2.77 mg Gallic Acid Equivalent/g coffee silverskin and a high antioxidant activity of 68.44 +/- 0.76{\%}. The extract solution was spray-dried to produce extract powder, which was then added to a basic skin gel with different extract concentrations. It was observed that the antioxidant activity of the gel increased with increasing extract concentration in the gel. This result showed that coffee silverskin has great potential as a source of antioxidants for various skin care products.},

abstract = {Context: Currently, there is a great tendency in cosmetic area to use natural extracts. Coffee silverskin (CS) is the most abundant solid by-product generated during roasting of coffee processing. Objectives: To evaluate different CS extracts as promising cosmetic ingredients, regarding antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic properties. Materials and methods: Aqueous, hydroalcoholic and ethanolic CS extracts were obtained by an environmentally friendly procedure considering costs and pollution. Extracts were characterized for total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC, respectively), antioxidant activity by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), antimicrobial activity expressed as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and cytotoxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl )-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays in two skin cell lines (fibroblasts and keratinocytes). Results: The TPC of extracts was 18.33-35.25 mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of material on a dry basis (mg GAE/g db). The TFC of extracts was 1.08-2.47 mu g cathechin equivalents per g dry material (mu g CE/g db). The antioxidant activity was high, with values ranging between 95.95 and 216.40 mu mol Fe2+/g for aqueous and alcoholic samples, respectively. Preliminary assays for antimicrobial potential showed that extracts display antibacterial activity. The MIC varied from 31.3 to 250 mu g/mL for Gram-positive, and from 31.3 to 1000 mu g/mL for Gram-negative. Extracts did not affect in vitro cell viability, with values near 100{\%} in all concentrations tested. Conclusion: Results seem show that CS is a safe source of natural antioxidants with antifungal and antibacterial activity and no cytotoxicity, with potential usefulness for cosmetic applications.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds is a byproduct from the soluble coffee company. Besides its use as animal feed or lipid source, it presents a high potential as biofuel. Whatever the application, to be useful, the product has to loose great part of its moisture content. The drying of spent coffee grounds in a cyclonic dryer was studied in the present work. Based on a experimental design, the effects of temperature of the air (Ta) (59 to 271 °C) and of the ratio mass flow rate of spent coffee grounds to mass flow rate of air (Wc/Wa) (0.1 to 3.6) on the moisture reduction (Mr) and average residence time of the particles on the cyclonic dryer (APRT) were studied. It was observed an inverse relation between Mr and the ratio Wc/Wa and a direct relation between Mr and Ta. Regarding the APRT, it presented an inverse relation to Wc/Wa. Additionally, the characterization of the spent coffee grounds was performed with respect to the centesimal composition, density and granulometric distribution. It was observed increasing the density and particle size with moisture increasing. It was shown that the cyclone could be an efficient dryer for particulate solids with the advantages of high moisture reduction within short residence time.},

abstract = {Recovery of phenolic content from waste is one of the main concerns for any possible applications. This study was done to investigate and explore the functional properties of cocoa waste (CW) from espresso cocoa production. The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay (DPPH), metal (Fe2+) chelating activity was determined. Parameters include water holding capacity (WHC), oil holding capacity (OHC), swelling capacity (SWC), proximate compositions, total dietary fiber (TDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and soluble dietary fiber (SDF) were also determined. As a reference spent coffee ground (SCG) was also studied under all parameters. Two solvents, ethanol and water were used to extract the bioactive compounds from CW. The ethanol-CW extract was found to contain significantly the highest (p {\textless} 0.05) TPC and TFC with 52.3 mg GAE/ml sample and 84.36 mg Quercetin/ml sample respectively. This was correlated to its high (p {\textless} 0.05) antioxidant activities in DPPH (IC50 3.58 +/- 0.07 mg/ml) and metal chelating activity (IC50 2.32 +/- 0.09 A mu g/ml). Positive correlations ranging from r(2) = 0.82 to 0.98 were established between the phytochemicals and antioxidant activities of all extracts. All samples displayed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) high WHC and SWC, in relevance to their high (p {\textless} 0.05) TDF which were over 60{\%} of 100 g dry matter. CW exhibited significantly high (p {\textless} 0.05) IDF/SDF ratio, in contrast to SCG with also high protein content of 13{\%}. This study indicates that CW has a potential as a source of natural antioxidant and phytochemical in functional food development and intermediate food ingredient.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are a significant residue produced annually worldwide. This by-product contains high levels of bioactive compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids that have recognized antioxidant properties. Recovery of these compounds previously for utilization in energy production is an interesting valorization approach, since they can be further incorporated in food products. A rapid, clean and reliable technique is required to discriminate SCG samples with high content of total phenolics, and total flavonoids as well as to assess their antioxidant capacity. In this work, Fourier-transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was used to determine the antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of several SCG samples (n=101). The antioxidant capacity of SCGs was determined by the ABTS assay, using the direct procedure that measures both soluble and insoluble antioxidant fractions and by the indirect approach that assesses the antioxidants present in SCG ethanolic extracts. FT-NIR spectra were calibrated against total flavonoid and total phenolic contents and the antioxidant capacity using PLS modeling. Spectral wavelength selection and latent variables were optimized for the lowest root mean square errors. All PLS models' results showed good linearity with an R2 for an independent test set of 0.93, 0.96, 0.95 and 0.95 for antioxidant capacity of SCGs, antioxidant capacity of SCG ethanolic extracts, and total flavonoid and total phenolic contents, respectively. The range error ratio (RER) was higher than 13 for all models (higher than 16 for three of them). Results confirmed that NIR spectroscopy is a promising technique for routine assessment of these parameters in SCGs and is a viable and advantageous alternative to chemical procedures involving laborious extractions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wet coffee waste (WCW) generated by the wet processing of coffee, is mainly made up of coffee pulp and husk, and has been scarcely studied and reutilized. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of an WCW ethanolic-extract (EWCW) obtained by ultrasonication (amplitude 70{\%}, sonication time 45 min). EWCW had total phenolic content of 33.8 mg gallic acid equivalents/g and antioxidant activity of 1790.1 mu mol Trolox equivalents/g. EWCW showed a potent in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Botryris cinerea, and Rhizopus stolonifer equivalent or superior to that of commercial synthetic carbendazim. Strawberries were wounded and inoculated with the three fungi for in vivo assays. After 5 d of inoculation, percentage of wounds presenting mold growth was of 16.7{\%} (400 mu g/mL of EWCW) and 38.2{\%} (1000 mu g/mL of carbendazim) for A. niger, and of 36.1{\%} for B. cinerea and of 50.12{\%} for R. stolonifer (2000 mu g/mL of EWCW) compared to the 38.2{\%} and 51.2{\%} (1000 mu g/mL of carbendazim), respectively. The efficient antifungal activity of EWCW can be mainly attributed to its majoritarian compounds chlorogenic acid (14.19 mg/g) and caffeic acid (1.18 mg/g), which represented 89.83{\%} of the identified compounds.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CSS) has various nutritional and functional properties, enabling it for valuable applications. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an efficient and economic extraction technique. In this research, UAE was employed in the extraction of bioactive compounds from CSS with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent. Extraction efficacy between the UAE-treated extracts and the UAE-untreated (control) was assessed in terms of the total phenolic content (TPC), caffeine content, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), and antioxidant capacities. The yields of TPC were in the range from 5.80 ± 0.06 to 8.94 ± 0.01 mg GAE/g sample. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity were highly enhanced by applying UAE compared to the controls. Noticeable caffeine content in the range from 3.27 ± 0.10 to 4.29 ± 0.01 g/100 g sample was found in the CSS samples. CGAs (3-CGA, 4-CGA, and 5-CGA) were all quantified. Methanol–water extracts showed significantly (p {\textless}.05) higher TPC, caffeine content, and antioxidant capacity than water extracts. The micro-structure investigation of CSS indicated UAE can cause cell disruption and micro cracks so that it can be an effective extraction technique. Peleg's model showed a good fitting (R2 {\textgreater} 0.94) to the experimental results on the kinetics of UAE of phenolics compounds. Practical applications: Coffee is a most consumed beverage internationally. Due to its great production, large quantities of residues including coffee pulp and husk, coffee silver skin, and spent coffee grounds are generated in the coffee industry. Among them, coffee silverskin (CSS) is a by-product during the coffee roasting process, which contains nutritional and functional properties. As an efficient and economic novel extraction technique, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed in the current study to extract bioactive compounds from coffee silverskin with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent in order to overcome various disadvantages encountered by the conventional extraction methods. Results indicated that application of UAE pretreatment showed significantly higher recovery of phenolic compounds compared to the controls and high ultrasound intensity (38 W/cm2) was more effective in recovering polyphenols compared to 5 W/cm2 ultrasonic treatments. Therefore, results from the current study provide useful and practical information for the coffee industry.},

Coffee silver skin (CSS), potato peel (PP) and brewer's spent grain (BSG) are voluminous by-products in their respective processing industries. The present study compared these three by-products for their prospective utilization in producing polyphenols-rich aqueous extracts by using ultrasound-assisted extractions (UAE). A probe-type sonicator was used for ultrasound treatments. The total phenolic contents in the extracts were assessed by Folin-Ciocalteu assay, while the phenolic profiles of the extract was characterized by LC-Q-TOF mass spectrometry. The microstructure of the samples after UAE was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ultrasound treatment enhanced the rate of extraction and recovered 2.79, 2.12 and 0.66 mg gallic acid equivalents/g of TPC from CSS, PP and BSG, respectively in 30 min, which correspond to recoveries of 97.6{\%}, 84.5{\%} and 84.6{\%}, respectively, compared to conventional solid-liquid extractions carried out for 24 h. The extraction yield was dependent on the particle size of the raw materials and the highest yield was obtained from the materials with 100-250 mu m particle size. The SEM imaging revealed that ultrasound treatment caused prominent tissue damage. Extracts contained mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of phenolic acids. PP and CSS had the highest amounts of umami free amino acids (0.13 mg/g in each), while BSG contained the highest amount of essential amino acids (92 mg/g). The present work shows that CSS, PP and BSG are good sources of polyphenols and UAE can be employed to enhance the extraction efficiency as means of a green approach.},

Putative type B feruloyl esterase (FAE) coding sequences found in the genome data of the basidiomycete were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant enzyme production on the 5-L bioreactor scale (Rs pCAE: 3245 U L-1) exceeded the productivity of the wild type strain by a factor of 800. Based on substrate specificity profiling, the purified recombinant Rs pCAE was classified as a p-coumaroyl esterase (pCAE) with a pronounced chlorogenic acid esterase side activity. The Rs pCAE was also active on methyl cinnamate, caffeate and ferulate and on feruloylated saccharides. The unprecedented substrate profile of Rs pCAE together with the lack of sequence similarity to known FAEs or pCAEs suggested that the Rs pCAE represents a new type of enzyme. Hydroxycinnamic acids were released from agro-industrial side-streams, such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB), sugar beet pectin (SBP) and coffee pulp (CP). Overnight incubation of coffee pulp with the Rs pCAE resulted in the efficient release of p-coumaric (100{\%}), caffeic (100{\%}) and ferulic acid (85{\%}) indicating possible applications for the valorization of food processing wastes and for the enhanced degradation of lignified biomass.

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CSS) is the only by-product from the coffee roasting process. This waste is generated on a large scale and most of it is disposed of as industrial waste. However, the rich composition of CSS in products such as phenolics, indicate its potential use as a source of chemicals. In this work, CSS pyrolysis oils and biochars have been studied within biorefinery concept in order to transform the coffee waste into energy and chemical source. Taking into account the effect of temperature on biochar and pyrolysis oil properties, CSS was pyrolysed at 280 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C. The resulting biochars presented significant calorific values, indicating its potential use as energy source for the coffee roasting process. GC-MS analysis showed that pyrolysis oils were mainly composed of caffeine, acetic acid, amino compounds and phenolics, the latter being the most important products due to their antioxidant properties. Antioxidant capacity of the samples were measured through Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH methods, showing an increase of phenolics in pyrolysis oils compared to CSS, mainly in 280 °C sample. Therefore, pyrolysis at 280 °C would allow the valorisation of CSS, coming closer towards circular economy and bioeconomy in the coffee industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.},

abstract = {Nowadays, coffee beans are almost exclusively used for the preparation of the beverage. The sustainability of coffee production can be achieved introducing new applications for the valorization of coffee by-products. Coffee silverskin is the by-product generated during roasting, and because of its powerful antioxidant capacity, coffee silverskin aqueous extract (CSE) may be used for other applications, such as antiaging cosmetics and dermaceutics. This study aims to contribute to the coffee sector's sustainability through the application of CSE to preserve skin health. Preclinical data regarding the antiaging properties of CSE employing human keratinocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans are collected during the present study. Accelerated aging was induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) in HaCaT cells and by ultraviolet radiation C (UVC) in C. elegans. Results suggest that the tested concentrations of coffee extracts were not cytotoxic, and CSE 1 mg/mL gave resistance to skin cells when oxidative damage was induced by t-BOOH. On the other hand, nematodes treated with CSE (1 mg/mL) showed a significant increased longevity compared to those cultured on a standard diet. In conclusion, our results support the antiaging properties of the CSE and its great potential for improving skin health due to its antioxidant character associated with phenols among other bioactive compounds present in the botanical material.},

abstract = {A critical and up-to-date review has been conducted on the latest individual valorization technologies aimed at the generation of value-added by-products from food wastes in the form of bio-fuels, bio-materials, value added components and bio-based adsorbents. The aim is to examine the associated advantages and drawbacks of each technique separately along with the assessment of process parameters affecting the efficiency of the generation of the bio-based products. Challenges faced during the processing of the wastes to each of the bio-products have been explained and future scopes stated. Among the many hurdles encountered in the successful and high yield generation of the bio-products is the complexity and variability in the composition of the food wastes along with the high inherent moisture content. Also, individual technologies have their own process configurations and operating parameters which may affect the yield and composition of the desired end product. All these require extensive study of the composition of the food wastes followed by their effective pre-treatments, judicial selection of the technological parameters and finally optimization of not only the process configurations but also in relation to the input food waste material. Attempt has also been made to address the hurdles faced during the implementation of such technologies on an industrial scale.},

abstract = {Microwave-assisted extraction is currently one of the most studied techniques for biomolecule recovery from natural sources, due to its favorable features for the treatment of thermo-sensitive compounds. In this work, the kinetic of antioxidant extraction from spent coffee grounds was investigated, focusing the attention on the effects of initial thermal ramp on the total polyphenol concentration, total solids and antiradical power of the final product. The hydro-alcoholic extracts demonstrated to be very rich of antioxidants with high antiradical power (from 0.45 to 0.88 mu(Tnolox equivalentig/)g(dried spent coffee grounds)), and their quality was significantly affected by the investigated variables. Peleg's model, was successfully used to describe extraction kinetics, whose investigation revealed that 10 min of heating time at 423 K provided the highest concentration of polyphenols, and resulted as a good compromise to perform a fast extraction with high extraction yields (43 mg(caffeic Acid Equivalent)/g(dried spent coffee grounds )after 60 min of extraction).

abstract = {Background. The main by-product of the coffee production chain is pulp; if it is not properly disposed of, it represents a serious environmental problem. Some studies suggest that this pulp can be used as a source of important compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the content of bioactive compounds present in coffee pulps and also to prepare a functional drink-type infusion to propose an alternative use of this by-product. Material and methods. In coffee pulps (Coffea arabica, var. Colombia and Caturra), the effect of the temperature and the extraction type over the content of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, condensed tannins and phenolic acids were determined. Moreover, the antioxidant activity by ABTS, ORAC and FRAP methodologies. With the best pulp, an infusion-type hot drink was prepared at 80 degrees C. Finally, sensory assessment was performed. Results. The best conditions to perform the metabolite extraction were room temperature and HC1 1{\%}. The highest trapping capacity of the cationic radical ABTS(+){\{}*{\}} was 24 782.93 mu mol Trolox Equivalent per 100 g of pulp, ORAC 57 087.82 mu mol Trolox Equivalent per 100 g of pulp and FRAP 806.93 mg of ascorbic acid equivalent per 100 g of pulp. For the infusion preparation, two drying methods were used - stove and lyophilization, and overall the best results correspond to the infusions prepared with the lyophilized plant material. This material also had good overall scores in the sensory test (3.51 to 4.04 on a scale of 1 to 5) been the taste most appreciated by the panelists. Conclusion. The bioactive compound concentration and the antioxidant activity of the coffee pulp suggest that waste can be used as a raw material for the preparation of functional foods, because the values found are similar or greater than those found in other drinks and fruits consumed commercially.},

The production of insects as livestock feed or as food ingredients requires strict monitoring of the content of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the growth substrate, to meet the security requirements. This study aims to investigate the presence of PTEs, like cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic, and nickel, in HI prepupae and in their growth substrates based on coffee roasting by-product and microalgae Schizochytrium sp. and Isochrysis sp. Analyses were carried out via graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry for Cd, Pb, Ni, and As, and via Direct Mercury Analyzer for Hg. All element concentrations found in growth substrates were below the legal limit of undesirable substances in animal feed (2002/32/EC). Elements concentrations in HI prepupae were in the range (mg kg(-1) wet weight) of 0.072 to 0.084 for Cd, 0.018 to 0.026 for Pb, 0.010 to 0.032 for Hg, 0.036 to 0.047 for As, and 0.18 to 0.76 for Ni. Even if HI prepupae accumulated Cd, Pb, and Hg, our results indicated that the risk of exposure to PTEs from HI prepupae consumption is relatively low and in compliance with EU regulations.},

abstract = {Coffee is the second largest traded commodity after oil and large amounts of by-products are generated in the coffee industry every year. In particular, coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the main coffee industry residues. CS is about 4.2{\%} (w/w) of coffee beans and the valorisation of this waste through the biorefinery approach may boost the circular economy development. In the present contribution, CS was pretreated with one of the mainly investigated biomass pretreatment reported in literature: alkaline hydrolysis in NaOH solutions. After enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated CS, the obtained sugars were used as carbon source to produce butanol and isopropanol by Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423. Moreover, fermentation tests were also carried out with synthetic media to investigate the effects of the alkaline pretreatment on the fermentation process. When pretreated CS was used as feedstock, the largest yields were 0.16 and 0.31 gsolvent/gsugars isopropanol and butanol, respectively. The reported results foster further studies regarding the reuse of CS for solvents production through fermentation processes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

Our results demonstrated that substitution of pro-mix by 10{\%} coffee pulp compost significantly increased aerial biomass, seedling height and number of nodes per plant. Substitution of pro-mix with 10 and 50{\%} coffee pulp compost increased seedling height by 20 and 4{\%}, respectively, compared to pure pro-mix media. Unamended peat moss and peat moss substituted with lower rate (10{\%}) of compost gave the lowest result in all response variables assessed. Top soil amended with 10{\%} CPCG gave remarkably higher root fresh and dry weight and AGFW per pot compared with unamended top soil and top soil amended with 1{\%} CPCG. In conclusion, substitution of Pro-mix media with coffee pulp compost up to 50{\%} and amendment of top soil with 5 and 10{\%} CPCG were found to be a good option for greenhouse/nursery tomato seedling production and field production of tomato, respectively.

abstract = {The valorisation of food waste is an increasingly practical and sustainable solution to the problem of a growing demand for chemicals, fuels and materials and the rising tonnage of municipal waste sent to landfill. Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the end product of the coffee processing industry, generated after beverage preparation, and have been exploited as a valuable source of polysaccharides, lipids, protein, minerals and bioactive secondary metabolites including diterpenes, sterols, chlorogenic acids, flavonoids and caffeine. Within the biorefinery paradigm, where renewable resources are converted into a range of high, medium and low value products, in an analogous manner to fossil fuels in a petrochemical refinery, SCG have been established as an amenable lignocellulosic feedstock through numerous research efforts. In this critical review, we give an extensive overview for the first time of the primary and secondary product suites that can be generated from SCG, along with their potential applications. The handful of preliminary technoeconomic and lifecycle assessment of using SCG for bioenergy is discussed, highlighting the economic limitations of a single capability, phase one biorefinery operating under the current scale and logistics of SCG collection. A concluding perspective towards future SCG-based biorefineries is presented, where isolation and production of higher value bioactive products is expected to be integral to the economic feasibility of the process.},

abstract = {This research focuses on the removal of contaminants from wastewaters as a matter of great interest in the field of water pollution. the first decades of the 21st century have brought numerous approaches for the development of cheaper and more effective adsorbents capable of eliminating heavy metals. the study aims to examine the way coffee pulp (Castilla variety from Caldas, Colombia) was used as a bioadsorbent for the removal of Mn (II) from synthetic wastewater to fulfill goals 3 and 6 proposed in the Sustainable Development Goals stated for the 2030 Agenda, particularly in Sections 3.9 and 6.9. In order to achieve this objective, the agricultural residue was subjected to bromatological characterization, determination of the lignocellulosic composition, and identification of characteristic organic functional groups through IR spectrophotometry, using the ATR (attenuated total reflection) technique. Additionally, the optimal parameters for contaminant removal were identified, regarding the biomass quantity, the optimum pH, the stirring time, the adsorption kinetics, the zero charge potential (pHpzc), the adsorption isotherms, and the explanation of the possible adsorption mechanisms between the contaminant, the surface of the coffee pulp, and the capacity of maximum adsorption. the results show that lignocellulosic material presented a cellulose content of 29.93 - 0.21{\%} and a lignin content of 19.25 - 0.16{\%}. the optimum parameters found were as follows: Particle size of 180 $\mu$m, contact time from 90 min to 100 RPM, optimum pH of 4.0 pH units, room temperature; the kinetic model adjusted to the bioadsorption process was Ho and McKay's pseudo-second-order, under an isotherm of the Langmuir model, for which the removal presented was 53.40{\%}, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 8.01 mg g-1. Finally, the novelty of the reported research consists of using coffee pulp as a bioadsorbent without chemical modification, for the removal of heavy metals, in this case Mn (II), in industrial wastewater, which would be another application of this coffee by-product. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The research of value-added applications for coffee silverskin (CSS) requires studies to investigate potential bioactive compounds and biological activities in CSS extracts. In this study, different ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) methods have been tested to extract bioactive compounds from CSS. The obtained extracts, were characterized using a new HPLC-MS/MS method to detect and quantify 30 bioactive compounds of 2 classes: alkaloids and polyphenols (including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and secoiridoids). CSS extracts obtained with ethanol/water (70:30) as extraction solvent showed the highest levels (p {\textless}= 0.05) of bioactive compounds (4.01 +/- 0.34{\%} w/w). High content of caffeine was observed with levels varying from 1.00{\%} to 3.59{\%} of dry weight of extract (dw). 18 phenolic compounds were detected in CSS extracts with caffeoylquinic acids (3-CQA, 5-CQA and 3,5-diCQA) as the most abundant polyphenols (3115.6 mu g g to -5444.0 mu g g(-1)). This study is also one of the first to characterize in-depth flavonoids in CSS revealing the levels of different flavonoids compounds such as rutin (1.63-8.70 mu g g(-1)), quercetin (1.53-2.46 mu g g(-1)), kaempferol (0.76-1.66 mu g g(-1)) and quercitrin (0.15-0.51 mu g g(-1)). Neuroprotective activity of silverskin extracts against H2O2-induced damage was evaluated for the first time suggesting for methanol and ethanol/water (70:30) extracts a potential role as protective agents against neurodegeneration due to their ability to counteract oxidative stress and maintain cell viability. Silverskin extracts were not inhibiting the growth of anyone of the bacterial species included in this study but data obtained by water extract might deserve a deeper future investigation on biofilm-related activities, such as quorum sensing or virulence factors' expression. From their composition and their evidenced biological activities, CSS extracts could represent valuable ingredients in nutraceutical formulations.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) represent one of the main residues derived from restoration and hostelry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SCG, included in the concentrate at different concentrations (0, 30, 50 and 100 g/kg), on milk yield and quality, feeding behaviour, dry matter intake, apparent digestibility and ruminal short chain fatty acid profile. In this trial of 51 days of duration, 48 Latxa dairy ewes were used. The ewes were blocked in quartets according to milk yield (1918 ± 287 g) and days in milk (35.7 ± 8.9 days). All of the concentrates were formulated to be isoenergetic (1.01 UFL), isoproteic (166 g/kg), isofat (76 g/kg) and to meet the production needs. The concentrate was given in two doses of 450 g of dry matter during the morning and afternoon milkings, and fescue hay was offered ad libitum. Milk production was recorded and samples were taken for fat, protein and lactose composition analysis. Dry matter intake and apparent dry matter digestibility were estimated using two markers, and feeding behaviour data was recorded. Increasing doses of SCG in the concentrate up to 100 g/kg resulted in a linear (P {\textless} 0.001) increase in the rumen of the isovaleric and isobutyric acid contents which could explain the observed quadratic response (P {\textless} 0.001) in milk yield and a linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in milk protein. A linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in milk fat was found which could be explained by the observed linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in ruminal acetic and butyric acid contents. Increasing doses of SCG in the concentrate linearly decreased ruminal (P {\textless} 0.001) propionic acid content, resulting in a concomitant linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in acetic:propionic ratio. Furthermore, no differences were found in intake, apparent dry matter digestibility and feeding behaviour. In conclusion, inclusion of SCG up to 100 g/kg in the concentrate modified ruminal fermentation pattern towards an increase in isoacids and acetic and butyric acid contents in the rumen with a concomitant improvement in milk production and composition without impairing feeding behaviour or apparent digestibility. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important commodities worldwide. The industrial processing of coffee cherries generates a considerable volume of by-products such as wastewater, coffee pulp, mucilage, and husk. These by-products have sugars and nutrients that can be converted into value-added products via microbial action. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the potential of coffee pulp and coffee wastewater as substrate for alcoholic fermentation produce a distilled beverage. The must composed by dry or wet coffee pulp and coffee wastewater added of commercial sucrose or sugarcane molasses was fermented by S. cerevisiae. After a screening step, a larger fermentation was carried out with the wet pulp added of sucrose due to its higher alcoholic fermentation efficiency. The distilled beverage contained 38{\%} (v/v) ethanol and 0.2 g/L of acetic acid. The contaminants furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural and ethyl carbamate were below detection level. Among the 48 volatile compounds detected, the majority (21) were ethyl esters usually associated with floral and sweet aromas. Ethyl decanoate (996.88 mu g/L) and ethyl dodecanoate (1088.09 mu g/L) were the most abundant esters. Coffee spirit presented taste acceptance of 80{\%} and sugarcane spirit, 70{\%}. The tasters indicated an aroma acceptance of 86{\%} for the coffee spirit and 78{\%} for the sugarcane spirit. The results of this work demonstrate the potential for using coffee by-products to produce a good quality distilled beverage. Considering our results, especially sensorial analysis, we can infer that the produced coffee beverage represents a new alternative for adding value to the coffee production chain.},

abstract = {A solid-liquid extraction method using ethanol-water mixtures was combined with cLC-DAD, LC-MS/MS and chemometric analyses for establishing the optimum extraction conditions of valuable polyphenols from spent coffee grounds. Chlorogenic and p-coumaric acids were the most abundant polyphenols found, ranging from 0.02 to 4.8 mg g(-1) and 0.173-0.50 mg g(-1), respectively. In addition, total polyphenol content (9-29 mg GAE g(-1) DW), total flavonoid content (11-27 mg QE g(-1) DW), total antioxidant activity (0.3 7 mg GAE g(-1) DW) and free radical scavenging ability (DPPH assay, 64-927 mu g extract g(-1) at EC50) of obtained extracts were determined. Response surface methodology allowed obtaining predictive models for the extraction of each individual polyphenol. On the other hand, multifactorial ANOVA was used to establish differences between coffee and spent coffee ground extracts. Principal component analysis was also employed to relate antioxidant activities, total polyphenol and total flavonoid contents with both the polyphenols extracted and the residue coffee type. The overall results suggested that spent coffee grounds could be reused as a promising, inexpensive and natural source of bioactive polyphenols with potential industrial applications, thus minimizing the waste disposal and environmental impact.

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are abundant, low-cost and versatile feedstocks for a wide range of high-valued end products. With a goal to achieve zero waste, this study aims to further broaden the diversity by using the residue for bioactive components, biodiesel production, as well as for the manufactures of activated carbon and fuel pellet. The analyzed SCG oil was rich in palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for more than 50 {\%} of the oil composition. Among different extraction methods, microwave-Assisted extraction (MAE) was found to be recommended for maximal yields of SCG's oil (17.00 {\%}) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (31.15 mg quercetin/g); while ultrasound-Assisted extraction (UAE) was more efficient toward the recovery of lipid hydroperoxide (LP) (0.0191 mM) and total phenolic content (TPC) (13.500 mg AG/g). Optimal SCG-over-solvent ratio was another studied parameter. The research also confirmed the antioxidant capability of the coffee grounds. The production of SCG's biodiesel followed the conventional esterification and transesterification processes. The assessment of the fuel complied with the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM 6751); and most of the analyzed values satisfied the standards. The activated carbon (AC) generated from SCG demonstrated a comparable purification capacity. The BET surface area and total pore volume were 1,547 m2/g and 0.225 cm3/g. For optimal area's value, a chemical activation by KOH, at 800 °C and 1:1-impregnation ratio was advisable. The solid waste after the oil extraction was used to produce fuel pellet with a high measured heating value (22 MJ/kg). The study underlined spent coffee grounds as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. The residue offered not only a cut in raw material's cost, but also an increase in net profit through the commercialization of other value-Added by-products.

abstract = {The production of phosphoric acid from phosphate rock leads to an industrial by-product called phosphogypsum (PG). One ton of phosphoric acid generates 5 tons of PG that is frequently stocked near the production units. Several attempts were made to test PG valorization via soil amendment because of its phosphate, sulphate and calcium content. In this study, the use of PG in composting was envisaged. Composts were produced by mixing olive oil wastes and spent coffee grounds. Two concentrations of PG, 10{\%} (A(10)) and 30{\%} (A(30)), were tested in composting substrate in addition to control compost without PG (A(T)). After 8 months of fermentation, the resulting composts were used in field experiments using nine different treatments conducted to evaluate the potential use of these PG-containing composts in potato plant (cv. Spunta) cultivation. Plants were grown in the field and the different composts (A(T), A(10) and A(30)) were added as fertilizer and compared to commercial compost and cattle manure. During the culture period, a number of physiological (dry weight, chlorophyll content, tuber yield) and biochemical parameters (antioxidant activities, mineral content, starch and protein content) were followed. Similarly, chlorophyll content was measured in plants cultivated on commercial or PG supplemented composts. An increment of 55.17{\%} in potato yield was recorded with the use of A(30) the compost. Collectively, these data reveal the positive impact of the addition of PG in composting which may be adopted as a strategy for PG valorization and its use for the production of high quality edible products.

abstract = {Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are important pests of numerous agricultural crops especially vegetables, able to cause remarkable yield losses correlated to soil nematode population densities at sowing or transplant. The concern on environmental risks, stemming from the use of chemical pesticides acting as nematicides, compels to their replacement with more sustainable pest control strategies. To verify the effect of aqueous extracts of the agro-industry waste coffee silverskin (CS) and brewers' spent grain (BSG) on the widespread root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, and on the physiology of tomato plants, a pot experiment was carried out in a glasshouse at 25 +/- 2 degrees C. The possible phytotoxicity of CS and BSG extracts was assessed on garden cress seeds. Tomato plants (landrace of Apulia Region) were transplanted in an artificial nematode infested soil with an initial population density of 3.17 eggs and juveniles/mL soil. CS and BSG were applied at rates of 50 and 100 {\%} (1L/pot). Untreated and Fenamiphos EC 240 (nematicide) (0.01 mu L a.i./mL soil) treated plants were used as controls. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chlorophyll content of tomato plants were estimated during the experiment. CS extract, at both doses, significantly reduced nematode population in comparison to the untreated control, although it was less effective than Fenamiphos. BSG extract did not reduce final nematode population compared to the control. Ten days after the first treatment, CS 100 {\%}, BSG 50 {\%} and BSG 100{\%} elicited the highest ROS values, which considerably affected the growth of tomato plants in comparison to the untreated plants. The control of these pests is meeting with difficulties because of the current national and international regulations in force, which are limiting the use of synthetic nematicides. Therefore, CS extracts could assume economic relevance, as alternative products to be used in sustainable strategies for nematode management.},

The valorization of inexpensive, abundantly available, and renewable biomass waste could provide significant benefits in response to increasing fossil fuel demands and manufacturing costs, as well as emerging environmental concerns. This review explores the potential for the use of available biomass waste to produce important chemicals, such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, biofuels, bioactive molecules, nanocellulose, and lignin, with a focus on commercially viable technologies.},

abstract = {Agrifood by-products are perfect candidates to be further processed under the concept of circular economy, in order to produce their valorization. Although significant amounts of food-related wastes that are discarded are produced worldwide, these might still be rich in valuable compounds. A strategy to further valorize agrifood-related by-products is based on pyrolysis processes. The result of this process is a liquid product termed bio-oil which is composed of an organic phase and an aqueous phase. This bio-oil is rich on a variety of components and its analysis implies several challenges. In this work, quantitative on-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) is proposed for the first time to characterize several aqueous phases of different bio-oils. Rice husk, peanut shell, spent coffee grounds, peach core and Eucalyptus sawdust biomasses were analyzed. The developed quantitative LC x LC method presented very good linearity, precision, reproducibility, recovery and LODs and LOQs as low as 0.05 mu g mL(-1) and 0.16 mu g mL(-1), respectively. As much as 28 components were simultaneously separated and quantified in those samples. Our results found that the composition of these bio-oils was different but strongly related to the agrifood by-product submitted to pyrolysis. The developed methodology is foreseen as a valuable tool for the quantitative study of other bio-oils, considering the great complexity and high dimensionality of these samples.

abstract = {The extraction of antioxidant phenolic compounds from spent coffee grounds (SCG) was studied. Extraction experiments were carried out by the conventional solid-liquid method, using methanol as solvent at different concentrations (20-100{\%}), solvent/solid ratios (10-40 ml/g SCG), and extraction times (30-90 min), and the influence of these operational variables on the content of total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of the produced extracts was evaluated. Flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, and protocatechuic acid were found in all the produced extracts and were also quantified. A strong influence (p {\textless} 0.05) of the variables on the extraction results was verified, and the conditions able to maximize each response (contents of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, chlorogenic acid and protocatechuic acid, and antioxidant activity) were established. Extraction using 60{\%} methanol in a solvent/solid ratio of 40 ml/g SCG, during 90 min, was the most suitable condition to produce a extract with high content of phenolic compounds (16 mg gallic acid equivalents/g SCG) and high antioxidant activity (FRAP of 0.10 mM Fe(II)/g), simultaneously. These findings are of interest since antioxidant phenolic compounds have an outstanding role in health area, and wide applications in food and pharmaceutical products. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The generation of nutrient-dense byproducts and coproducts with high-moisture contents are considered to be an issue for global food industries. These byproducts and coproducts spontaneously undergo chemical, biochemical, or microbial deteriorations due to high storage-temperatures, and consequently are turned into direct animal feed sources or even just treated as waste with eutrophication activity. This review provides an overview of selected mass-produced botanical food byproducts and coproducts (BFBC) including soybean okara, wheat germ, banana, and spent coffee grounds, with respect to value-added sustainable processing via proper drying technologies being employed. This review includes the current production of the above-mentioned agricultural products, the nutritional aspects of them, and the sustainable utilization of their coproducts.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The total amount of bio-waste produced annually in the EU by the food and beverage chains is estimated at 37 billion kg. The use of insects for the valorization of by-products from these value chains may represent a sustainable solution. This study aimed to investigate the by-products obtained from different food chains and used for the rearing of black soldier fly (BSF) prepupae, and to evaluate the content and profile of the lipid extracted from the prepupae and outline its possible applications. The substrates used in this experiment were: (i) industrial by-products (brewery spent grains, cows' milk whey, grape stalks, and tomato peels and seeds) and (ii) by-products from retailers (bread dough, fish scraps, and spent coffee ground). Fat extracted from prepupae using an adjusted Folch method was used for total lipid content and fatty acid profile. RESULTS: The best larval performances were obtained from beer (0.22 gweight per prepupa), tomato (0.19 gweight per prepupa), and cheese (0.14 gweight per prepupa) food-chain by-products. The extremely different compositions of the substrates were reflected in the differentiated lipid profile of the BSF prepupae and in the range of ratios between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, which varied from 0.37 for cows' milk whey to 1.34 for tomato peels and seeds. CONCLUSION: The lipids, proteins, and chitin extracted from prepupae are high-value bio-based products that could be used in the feed / food industry or for the development of innovative biomaterials, such as biodiesel. These results suggest that food-chain by-products are the best candidates for insect-bioconversion purposes. {\textcopyright} 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. {\textcopyright} 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract = {Coffee is the second traded food commodity in the world. Beyond roasted seeds, the most part of the original fruit-and in particular pulp- is discarded as waste, with severe environmental and economic consequences in many developing countries. Our research focused on developing an eco-friendly extraction protocol of phyto-complexes from coffee pulp and evaluating their bioactivity and beneficial effects to human health as food supplements. Antioxidant activity assays (Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH assays) were adopted to select the most effective extraction technique and results show antioxidant activity of coffee pulp extracts. After analysis of cytotoxicity on human epithelial gastric cells, measurements of IL-8 release of treated or pre-treated cells were performed. Results showed that the use of soft technical equipment and sustainable solvents (i.e. maceration process, aqueous extraction) can extract phytocomplexes with antioxidant properties. Moreover, IL-8 measurements showed impairment of this chemokine release at concentrations that may be reached in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract, following consumption of reasonable amount of extract. Pre-treatments analysis demonstrated the ability of coffee pulp extracts to prevent IL-8 release by gastric epithelial cells. Chemical evaluation performed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry showed that quinic acid derivatives are abundant in coffee pulp extract together with procyanidins derivatives: those compounds might be responsible for the high biological activity. This evidence supports future applications of coffee pulp extracts as food supplement with high added value, starting from a waste that can be valorized through simple yet efficient extraction methods.},

abstract = {Here in this study, co-pyrolysis of paper mill sludge (PMS) and spent coffee ground (SCG) was conducted to mainly recover energy and additionally produce engineered biochar as an adsorbent. More specifically, to enhance the generation of syngas (H-2 and CO) through co-pyrolysis of PMS and SCG and modify the physicochemical properties of biochar, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as reaction medium. The CO2 co-feeding impact on co-pyrolysis with various mass ratios of PMS and SCG was also evaluated to explore any catalytic effects arising from CO2 and Fe/Ca species in PMS. The decrease in pyrolytic oil substances was apparent due to the synergistic effects of CO2 and Fe/Ca species. Moreover, the generation of CO was catalytically enhanced in the presence of Fe/Ca species in PMS. Co-pyrolysis in CO2 not only converted the impregnated Fe ions into magnetite (Fe3O4), but also created porous biochar. One biochar fabricated at the optimal mass ratio (PMS: SCG = 7:3) exhibited the highest adsorption capability toward As(V) due to adequate balancing between the amount of Fe/Ca solid minerals and biochar porosity. As a result, co-pyrolysis using CO2 as reaction medium can be a feasible option for the generation of CO along with production of biochar as a byproduct which can be used in environmental application.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are an abundant by-product of the coffee industry with a complex composition that makes them a promising feedstock for a biorefinery. The objective of this study was to evaluate SCG as a substrate for combined chlorogenic acid and bioethanol production after dilute acid hydrolysis. The effect of phenolics extraction on the downstream process was evaluated exhibiting no loss of sugars and an increase in the sugar release efficiency during the dilute acid hydrolysis. In order to suggest an economically feasible process, phenolics extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis prior to ethanol fermentation were optimised by means of experimental design. The responses of the designs were not only the efficiencies of the processes, but also a balance between product recovery and estimated costs. In both cases, decreased efficiencies obtained with low liquid-solid ratios were countervailed by increased products concentrations and higher economical performance. Under the optimised conditions, the purity of the phenolics extract (32{\%}) could allow it to enter the market as a dietary supplement of chlorogenic acid, a product with high trade value. Moreover, a concentration of 3.9{\%} (w/v) ethanol was reached upon fermentation of the hydrolysate of SCG after extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Cultivation with TPEW and SCG did not result in any significant differences in the contents of K, Mg, P, and S in fruiting bodies. The highest content of Ca and Na was recorded in cultivation with TPEW. The use of TPEW and SCG increased the total phenolic content, while in the phenolic profile changes were observed in the variants of 50{\%} and 100{\%} TPEW and 50{\%} SCG. Cultivation with TPEW increased the sum of the organic acids and quinic, malonic, malic, acetic, and succinic acids, while addition of SCG resulted in their significant decrease. Practical applications The use of different additives to growing substrate is a possible way to improve the harvest yield. Moreover, this modification of cultivation allows to manage some waste materials. However, the application of waste materials can carry the risk to introduce substances potentially dangerous for human health into substrate. Additionally, the supplementation allows to modify the content of bioactive compounds. In this context, the monitoring of the quality of fruiting bodies seems to be necessary.

The aim is to estimate the effect of a wide number variables on the amount of caffeine and phytochemicals recovered with a green method for water-soluble compounds that does not require the use of organic solvents. In the first part, we use a Plackett-Burman design to estimate which extraction parameters have most influence on phytochemical recovery. In the second part, we test only the significant factors and caffeine and chlorogenic acids were quantified using HPLC-DAD. The first part of the study showed that the temperature and the type of SCG can significantlyaffect the phytochemical recovery. In the second part, four temperatures and two types of SCG were tested and thehigher concentrations of caffeine and chlorogenic acids were found at 110 degrees C. Furthermore, a significant effect was found for type of SCG with significantly higher phytochemical recovery for the French Press compared to the Espresso method. The mild temperature, combined with the use of water as a solvent make the recovery system both green and low-cost. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Significance and Impact of the StudySpent coffee grounds (SCG) represent solid waste generated in millions of tonnes by coffee-processing industries. Their disposal represents a serious environmental problem; however, SCG could be valorized within a biorefinery concept yielding various valuable products. Herein, we suggest that SCG can be used as a complex carbon source for the lactic acid production.},

abstract = {To obtain the coffee beverage, approximately 90{\%} of the edible parts of the coffee cherry are discarded as agricultural waste or by-products (cascara or husk, parchment, mucilage, silverskin and spent coffee grounds). These by-products are a potential source of nutrients and non-nutrient health-promoting compounds, which can be used as a whole ingredient or as an enriched extract of a specific compound. The chemical composition of by-products also determines food safety of the novel ingredients. To ensure the food safety of coffee by-products to be used as novel ingredients for the general consumer population, pesticides, mycotoxins, acrylamide and gluten must be analyzed. According with the priorities proposed by the Food Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to maximize the benefit for the environment, society and economy, food waste generation should be avoided in the first place. In this context, the valorization of food waste can be carried out through an integrated bio-refinery approach to produce nutrients and bioactive molecules for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and non-food applications. The present research is an updated literature review of the definition of coffee by-products, their composition, safety and those food applications which have been proposed or made commercially available to date based on their chemical composition. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

Largely consumed foods are rich sources of phenol polymers, notably black foods traditionally used in East Asia, but other non-edible, easily accessible sources, e.g., seaweeds and wood, have been considered with increasing interest together with waste materials from agro-based industries, primarily grape pomace and other byproducts of fruit and coffee processing. Not in all cases were the main structural components of these materials identified because of their highly heterogeneous nature. The great beneficial effects of natural phenol-based polymers on human health and their potential in improving the quality of food were largely explored, and this review critically addresses the most interesting and innovative reports in the field of nutrition and biomedicine that have appeared in the last five years. Several in vivo human and animal trials supported the proposed use of these materials as food supplements and for amelioration of the health and production of livestock. Biocompatible and stable functional polymers prepared by peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols, as well as natural phenol polymers were exploited as conventional and green plastic additives in smart packaging and food-spoilage prevention applications. The potential of natural phenol polymers in regenerative biomedicine as additives of biomaterials to promote growth and differentiation of osteoblasts is also discussed.},

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most popular beverages (almost 9 million tons of coffee was consumed in 2014) and the second largest commodity traded worldwide. Coffee beans have long been used for human consumption, in the last centuries, producing coffee brews and instant coffee. About 50{\%} of the coffee produced is directed for the production of soluble coffee generating spent coffee grounds (SCG) as a byproduct that is rich in carbohydrates, protein, lipids and bioactive molecules. SCG has found application as compost (soil conditioner), animal feed (poultry and ruminants), mushroom production, a substrate for fermentation (enzymes) and energy (biogas, liquid biofuel and bioelectricity). SCG composition and structure depends on the coffee beans used in the coffee production, as well as the industrial extraction process. The instant coffee manufacturing uses several hot water extraction steps with different temperature and its severity influences in the soluble solids extraction from the roasted beans and the characteristics of the generated SCG. The industrial process impacts on the amount of SCG generated and soluble compounds extraction, in average 4 kg of wet SCG per kilogram of instant coffee produced. Moreover, the structure of the remained polysaccharides in SCG, cellulose, galactomannan and arabinogalactan, can be more recalcitrant to further use. The SCG still contain extractable compounds (flavor and oil) in a lignocellulosic matrix formed by cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. These structural compounds are organized in the cell wall as a recalcitrant structure to the biological conversion process. Moreover, SCG is resistant to degradation and may need a pretreatment to make the material suitable for biotechnological conversion. The pretreatment disrupts the cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin structure, changing its properties and allowing a complex of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes breaking down polysaccharides into fermentable sugars. The factors responsible for SCG recalcitrance is related to its chemical composition, structural and physicochemical properties that influence the pretreatment response end requires a complex pool of enzymes to its hydrolysis. This review will focus on discuss the recalcitrance properties of the SCG, based on its composition and structural organization, and the complex enzyme necessary for its conversion, highlighting its impact on biotechnology and bioenergy process. {\textcopyright} 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The independent variables which affect SCWH were optimized using response surface methodology. The highest yield of SCG polysaccharides (SCGPSs) (18.25 +/- 0.21{\%}) was obtained using ultrasonic pretreatment and SCWH conditions of temperature (178.85 degrees C), pressure (20 bar), and extraction time (5 min). The extracted SCGPSs showed high antioxidant activity as measured using ABTS(+) and DPPH radical scavenging assay with 1050 values of 1.83 +/- 0.03 and 2.66 +/- 0.13 mg/ml respectively. SCGPSs also showed in vitro hypoglycemic activities. The structural and thermal characterization of the polysaccharide showed that the extracted polysaccharide has a typical carbohydrate features. The results of this study suggested that the extracted polysaccharide could have a potential application in food and related industries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spent Coffee Grounds worldwide production is estimated at around 6 M tons only at industrial level. The abundance and the heterogeneity of this substrate make it an ideal substrate for a biorefinery approach based on the ``cascade biorefinery hierarchy{\{}''{\}}. Currently, the major part of spent coffee grounds is sent to incineration and landfill disposal, options which should be avoided. Instead, they could be valorised through biofuels production. All the operational parameters leading to the highest biogas (350-400L(CH4)/kg(TVS)), bioethanol (3-4{\%}v/v) and biodiesel (over 90{\%} of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters concentration) yields from spent coffee grounds have been discussed in this review paper. They are rich in an oil phase containing different added-value molecules (tocopherols, cafestol, kahweol along with linoleic and palmitic acids), which can be extracted and used as additives for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Solid/liquid extraction techniques of coffee oil from spent coffee grounds such as the most common Soxhlet technique and the more innovative fluids in supercritical conditions have been discussed, with coffee oil recovery of around 5-15{\%}w/w and 15-20{\%}w/w, respectively. The most recent applications of the extracted coffee oil have been also presented: the added-value molecules recovery and purification after micro/ultra and nano filtrations processes and the polyhydroxyalkanoates (0.84 g/g) and biosurfactants (3.5 g/L) production. Considering the whole information, an integrated biorefinery scheme, along with the respective mass balances were proposed. The novelty of this paper lies in the integration of the state-of-the-art data, in a biorefinery concept that would allow the production of both biofuels and value-added products.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin is the major by-product of coffee roasting. Among all the coffee by-products, it is a relatively stable product due to its low moisture content. Currently, silverskin is used as direct fuel (e.g. firelighters), for composting and soil fertilization. As it is a natural source of several bioactive compounds that can be extracted and further used for food or dermocosmetic purposes, the valorization of this by-product is of utmost importance, having in view the sustainability and circular economy principles. The aim of this work was to evaluate, for the first time, the influence of different geographical origins (Brazil, Uganda, Vietnam, Cameroon, Indonesia, and India) on the chemical composition of silverskin obtained from Coffea canephora beans. Different parameters were analysed, including ashes, protein, soluble and insoluble fiber, and total lipid amounts; vitamin E, fatty acid and phenolics profiles (by HPLC-DAD-FLD, GC-FID, and HPLC-DAD, respectively); caffeine, 5 caffeoylquinic acid and hydroxymethyfurfural contents (by HPLC-DAD); and antioxidant profile (total phenolics and flavonoids contents, DPPH center dot inhibition, and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power). Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were found between the samples, especially regarding the fatty acid profile and the antioxidant composition. For instance, the Brazilian silverskin was the richest in total lipids and vitamin E, while the Indian silverskin was the poorest in phenolics and antioxidant activity, and presented a higher relative percentage of saturated fatty acids. A Principal ComponentAnalysis allowed to group the studied samples according to their geographical proximity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The coffee residue left after the preparation of the brew (spent coffee grounds - SCG) is very rich in polysaccharides, namely galactomannans and arabinogalactans, which are polymers that can be used as dietary fibre and present immunostimulatory activity. Considering the huge amount of SCG produced all over the world, the reutilisation of this by-product by its application as food ingredients is very promising. However, the yields of extraction of these polysaccharides tend to be very low, namely the galactomannans. Based on the observation that the yield of galactomannans extracted from the ground coffee to the brew increase when the coffee is roasted, in this study, with the aim of increasing the yield of these polysaccharides, the SCG was roasted and then extracted with hot water and alkali solutions. The roasting at 160 °C promoted an increment of 15{\%} in the yield of galactomannan extractions and further improvement of the yield of extraction until 56{\%} of all galactomannans was achieved by alkali extractions at 60 and 120 °C. In these samples the galactomannans still kept their characteristic structure, including the acetylation and branching, determined by sugar linkage analysis and mass spectrometry. The yield of extraction of arabinogalactans under these conditions was 54{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Process efficiency depends on dielectric properties; however, data of these by-products are scarce in literature. The present study is focused on the effect of temperature and moisture content (M) on the dielectric constant (epsilon `) and loss (epsilon `') of carrot waste, apple pomace, pineapple peel and spent coffee grounds at 2.45 GHz. Results on epsilon ` showed moisture-dependent temperature effect with an inflection point atM= 50.3{\%}. The epsilon `' increased with increasingMup to 60{\%} and decreased at higher moisture levels. Results at different temperatures were significantly affected by the composition of the studied materials and thus the calculated power penetration depth. Although fresh food dielectric properties are available in literature, the data is not always suitable to estimate food waste properties as processing may cause compositional changes. The obtained results support microwave process optimization in the field of food-waste valorization.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) and spent tea leaves (STL) are constantly rejected either on a domestic scale or more widely on an industrial level. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the potential use of their aqueous extracts as organic priming agents in pepper (Capsicum annuumL.) in vitro germination under salt (NaCl, 102.66 mM) or drought (PEG 6000, 4{\%}) stress for 384 h. Extraction from SCG and STL were achieved by three conventional techniques (infusion, boiling and incubation at room temperature). Thereafter, different concentrations from each by-product were examined. The results showed that, under salt stress, STL extract at 1.5{\%} dry tea leaves (DTL), obtained by infusion extraction, displayed the best response in terms of final germination percentage (FGP), time taken for cumulative germination to reach 50{\%} of its maximum (t50) and germination uniformity (U-7525), whereas, the best improve in root length was obtained with 2.25{\%} DTL compared with unprimed culture. Against drought stress, SCG extract at 4{\%} dry coffee ground (DCG), obtained following incubation extraction, resulted in amelioration in FGP and U-7525, however, 2{\%} DCG engendered the best stimulation of growth. Added directly to the medium culture, STL (1.5{\%} DTL) caused a highly significant inhibition of the germination process with both types of stress. However, SCG (2{\%} DCG) supplementation is recommended mainly in drought stress to improve seedlings growth. Organic priming and medium supplementation can be alternative pathways for SCG and STL wastes valorization. Furthermore, these techniques can be a good cropping practice to improve seed potentiality against environmental challenges in sustainable agriculture. {\{}[{\}}GRAPHICS] .},

abstract = {Application of enzymes in biotechnological process has expanded considerably in recent years. In food and related industry, major importance was being attached to the use of enzymes in upgrading quality, increasing yields of extractive processes, product stabilization, and improvement of flavor and byproduct utilization. Pectinases or pectinolytic enzymes are today one of the upcoming enzymes of the commercial sector. It has been reported that microbial pectinases account for 25{\%} of the global food enzymes sales. For this reason, this study was undertaken with aims of screening microorganisms for the pectinase activity from coffee pulp samples and molecular identification of the potential pectinolytic isolates. In the present investigation, in total, ninetyfive (95) isolates were identified from thirty coffee pulp samples. Based on characterization on the selective growth media, the isolates were grouped as actinomycete (21.06{\%}), bacteria (65.26{\%}), and fungi (13.68{\%}). Among these, 31.58{\%} showed colonies surrounded by clear zones which indicate the presence of pectinase activity. After rigorous screening steps, the isolates with high potential pectinase activity were identified molecularly by sequencing 16S rDNA region of the isolates. Based on the molecular identifications, about 70{\%} of the isolates are under genus Bacillus.},

abstract = {In this study, we assess the potential of supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS) for valorization of spent coffee grounds (SCG). SUPRAS, made up of self-assembled amphiphilic aggregates dispersed in an aqueous or hydro-organic medium, are excellent extractants that provide multiple binding interactions (hydrogen bonds, dispersion, dipole-dipole, etc.) and microenvironments of different polarity due to their special internal architecture. In this work, SUPRAS made up of different amphiphiles (decanoic acid and hexanol) and hydro-organic media (water-ethanol and water-tetrahydrofuran) were investigated for extraction of bioactives from SCG. Extraction was optimized from the yield obtained for caffeine and 5-chlorogenic acid, that were considered as model compounds. Under optimal extraction conditions, the profile of bioactive compounds in the extracts was screened by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and the total phenolic content was estimated. The antioxidants and antimicrobial properties of the extracts were also evaluated. Bioactive compounds were extracted from wet SCG up to 3.32 mg g(-1) and 4.3 mg g(-1) SCG of caffeine and chlorogenic acid, respectively. Extracts showed antioxidant capacity by different assays (DPPH, TEAC, FRAP) in accordance with their high total phenolic content (60.1 mg CGA per mg of extracted dry SCG). SUPRAS offered advantages in terms of rapidity (extraction for 1 min) and simplicity (the process involved stirring and centrifugation at room temperature), thus avoiding costly processes based on high pressure and temperature. Furthermore, SUPRAS extracts exhibited certain degree of antimicrobial effects against, S. aureus and B. cereus and a high effect against S. enterica and P. putida.},

Intensity of specific sensory characteristics in cookies added with SCG was evaluated by 131 consumers using the just-about-right scale. Texture characteristics were not affected by SCG content. Crude fiber, fat, ash and TPC content increased with the increment of SCG in cookies (p {\textless}.01).

The inclusion of antioxidants in topical formulations can contribute to minimize oxidative stress in the skin, which has been associated with aging. Also, questions of sustainability are leading to the study of new cosmetic ingredients obtained from food by-products. Coffee Silverskin (CS) is a food by-product with established antioxidant activity that has not yet been incorporated into a topical formulation.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical and microbiological stabilities and antioxidant activity of a hand cream formulation containing 2.5{\%} (w/w) of CS extract upon production and after 6 months of shelf-life and in vitro safety/cytotoxicity on skin cell lines after production.Materials and methods: The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated with MTS and LDH assays, at different concentrations, in HaCaT and HFF-1 cells. Formulations were stored at 25 degrees C/65{\%} RH and 40 degrees C/75{\%} RH. Physical, microbiological, and antioxidant stabilities were evaluated by centrifugation, viscosity, total colony count, DPPH and total phenolic content (TPC).Results: The hand cream containing 2.5{\%} (w/w) of CS extract showed stable physical characteristics independently of the storage conditions. The DPPH activity and TPC of the CS formulation were significantly higher compared with those of the base formulation. However, during storage, the antioxidant activity decreases slightly. Microbiological quality was also confirmed. No cytotoxic effects were observed.Conclusion: It is possible to suggest that this formulation is stable under extreme conditions and safe for topical use.},

abstract = {Coffee bean tegument (silverskin) is a by-product derived from the coffee roasting process. This residue has been discarded, which constitutes a serious environmental problem. The depletion of oil reserves and environmental issues promoted by the combustion of fossil fuels has generated interest in the use of biomass to obtain fuel and chemicals products. The liquid product obtained by biomass pyrolysis is commonly called bio-oil. Bio-oil is a complex mixture of compounds, and its detailed chemical characterization is necessary to prospect its potential uses. Therefore, this study optimized the final temperature of pyrolysis and N-2 flow rate parameters for the pyrolysis of silverskin in a fixed bed reactor, by using a central composite design and response surface. The bio-oil chemical composition was evaluated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to rapid-scanning quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC x GC/qMS), combined with the use of standards and linear temperature-programmed retention indices (LTPRI). The optimal values. calculated were 560 degrees C for the final pyrolysis temperature and 49 mL min(-1) for the N-2 flow rate. The organic phase yield was 15.2{\%} under these conditions. At the optimal conditions, 228 compounds were identified (90.1{\%} of the sample chromatographic volume) in the organic phase. The major chemical class, in terms of volume percentage, were the phenols (26.70{\%}), followed by nitrogen compounds (18.51{\%}). In addition, it is worth mentioning the high represent ability of the saturated hydrocarbons (8.28{\%}), unsaturated aliphatic (6.69{\%}), and aromatics (7.77{\%}), which together account for 22.74{\%} of the sample chromatographic volume. These results showed that the silverskin bio-oil may have the potential use as a source of chemical inputs.},

abstract = {The present research aimed to evaluate the use of spent coffee grounds (SCG) from instant coffee as a food ingredient and its application in bakery products. Data on physicochemical characterization, thermal stability and food safety of SCG were acquired. Evaluation of feasibility as dietary fibre was also determined. Results showed SCG are natural source of antioxidant insoluble fibre, essential amino acids, low glycaemic sugars, resistant to thermal food processing and digestion process, and totally safe. In the present work, SCG were incorporated in biscuit formulations for the first time. Low-calorie sweeteners and oligofructose were also included in the food formulations. Nutritional quality, chemical (acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural and advanced glycation end products) and microbiological safety and sensory tests of the biscuits were carried out. Innovative biscuits were obtained according to consumers' preferences with high nutritional and sensorial quality and potential to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {Wet coffee pulp (WCP), produced as waste from coffee production, is a rich source of bioactive compounds, especially caffeine and chlorogenic acid. However, it contains high moisture content, thus it is challenging for further utilization due to degradation and microbial deterioration. Dehydration is, therefore, necessary to minimize degradation and ease storage and transportation. As a waste, the common drying methods should be prioritized to be feasible for industrial application. This study aimed to determine the impact of different drying conditions of the three common drying methods including low temperature and pressure, vacuum and hot air drying on physical, phytochemical and antioxidant properties of WCP to identify the most suitable drying conditions. Browning index, moisture content, total phenolic content (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), proanthocyanidins, and chlorogenic acid as well as the antioxidant properties of the dried coffee pulp were significantly influenced by different tested conditions. Vacuum drying was found to be more suitable for drying the wet coffee pulp as compared to low temperature and pressure and hot air drying methods. Vacuum drying at 110 °C retained the highest TPC (14.4 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry weight (DW)), proanthocyanidins (6.8 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/g DW), TFC (13.2 CE/g DW), caffeine (2.9 mg/g DW) and antioxidant capacity. Chlorogenic acid (3.4 mg/g DW) was 13{\%} lower, but energy consumption was 37{\%} less than vacuum drying at 90 °C. Therefore, vacuum drying (3.75 mmHg) at 110 °C for 4h 05 min was suggested for dehydration of the wet coffee pulp for subsequent recovery and processing. {\textcopyright} 2020},

This study evaluated the production of bioethanol and volatile compounds of eight yeast strains cultivated in a mixture of these residues. Hanseniaspora uvarum UFLA CAF76 showed the best fermentation performance; hence it was selected to evaluate different culture medium compositions and inoculum size. The best results were obtained with 12{\%} w/v of coffee pulp, 1 g/L of yeast extract and 0.3 g/L of inoculum. Using these conditions, fermentation in 1 L of medium was carried out, achieving higher ethanol yield, productivity and efficiency with values of 0.48 g/g, 0.55 g/L h and 94.11{\%} respectively. Twenty-one volatile compounds corresponding to higher alcohols, acetates, terpenes, aldehydes and volatile acids were identified by GC-FID. Such results indicate that coffee residues show an excellent potential as substrates for production of value-added compounds. H. uvarum demonstrated high fermentative capacity using these residues.

The effect of the major variables (solvent polarity, temperature and extraction time) affecting the extraction yields of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of silverskin extracts was evaluated. The extracts composition varied significantly with the extraction conditions used. A factorial experimental design showed that the use of a hydroalcoholic solvent (50{\%}:50{\%}) at 40 degrees C for 60 minis a sustainable option to maximize the extraction yield of bioactive compounds and the antioxidant capacity of extracts. Using this set of conditions it was possible to obtain extracts containing total phenolics (302.5+/-7.1 mg GAE/L), tannins (0.43+/-0.06 mg TAE/L), and flavonoids (83.0 +/- 1.4 mg ECE/L), exhibiting DPPH center dot scavenging activity (326.0+/-5.7 mg TE/L) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (1791.9+/-126.3 mg SFE/L).

abstract = {Mexico is one of the world leaders in the production of coffee, but research on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity in Mexican coffee has been extremely limited and, importantly, the effect of organic farming on these properties has not been widely studied. Spent coffee grounds (SCG), the main by-product of coffee brewing, represent a serious environmental problem, but could become an important source of bioactive compounds for the pharmaceutical and food-processing industry. The aim of this work was, therefore, to study the effect of organic farming on bioactive and antioxidant properties of SCG; comparing samples of organic and conventionally grown coffee from the Mexican states of Veracruz and Chiapas, both of which produce coffee with the `Protected Designation of Origin' distinction. Concentrations of total phenolic compound and total flavonoid compounds, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2 `-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline 6- sulphonic-acid) antioxidant activity, and brown compound concentration were determined in SCG. Repeated measures ANOVAs were carried out on the data. Organic SCG samples showed significantly higher bioactive compound concentration (p {\textless} 0.01) and antioxidant activity (p {\textless} 0.001) than conventional SCG samples. This difference held across various extractions and the two geographical locations. Thus, this Mexican organic coffee by-product may represent an interesting source of such compounds for diverse industrial applications. Given that Mexico is one of the top producers of organic coffee in the world, there is a need for further research to consider other important variables, such as the type of coffee processing by-product and the type of coffee extraction process.},

abstract = {The present study considers the establishment of a biomass gasification model using for its validation, experimental data obtained in a 15-20 kg/h coffee pulp downdraft gasifier unit, operated at ICAFE-Costa Rica. The gasification model proposed considers a heterogeneous ``downflow{\{}''{\}} central section and a homogeneous ``upflow{\{}''{\}} exit section, both operating at chemical equilibrium. Each of the sections includes a number of relevant independent chemical reactions. Biomass is incorporated into the model using its elemental composition as well as its water content. Different reaction paths are examined in order to analyze the applicability of the various assumptions considered. The established model accounts for biochar thermodynamic properties as well as gasifier operating temperatures in the homogenous ``upflow{\{}''{\}} section, using a numerical fitting method. With this approach, the proposed model successfully predicts the molar fractions of various syngas components, most notably, the CH4 and H-2 fractions via the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, as well as the carbon converted. It is anticipated that the developed model will provide a valuable simulation and design tool for scaled-up downdraft biomass gasifiers.},

abstract = {Currently, many research studies are being carried out on the production of alcohol from lignocellulosic biomasses. In this study, the ethanol obtained from a mixture of coffee pulp and mucilage, commercial baker's yeast and panela (dehydrated and solidified cane juice) was evaluated. The pulp and mucilage of coffee underwent an acid hydrolysis, and the wort (pulp juice and mucilage) was fermented with an inoculum of exponential phase Saccharomyces cerevisiae and commercial whole panela. The fermented product was distilled, and the gas chromatographic analysis showed an ethanol yield of 25.44 kg/m3, resulting from the 64.40 kg/m3of total sugars, such yield is equivalent to 77.29{\%} of the theoretical yield. This fact shows that the production of ethanol is viable in small coffee farms using readily available raw materials. The stillage was analyzed and it presented the following values: 0.40 ppm (Iron), 0.97 ppm (Magnesium), 1.54 ppm (Calcium), and 4.40 ppm (Phosphorus). The results confirm that they are particularly useful as a complement in the production of bio-fertilizers for earthworms.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the strength and microstructure properties of spent coffee grounds stabilized with rice husk ash and slag geopolymers to produce a green construction subgrade material. Spent coffee grounds (CG) and rice husk ash (RHA) are organic wastes derived from agricultural products. CG is the residue from ground coffee beans. RHA is a by-product from the burning rice husk used to generate electricity. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (S) is a waste by-product derived from steel production. RHA and S were used as geopolymeric precursors (P). This study provides an insight on the long-term strength performance and microstructural formation of geopolymers synthesized from agricultural waste products. The influence factors studied were liquid alkaline activator content (L), RHA content, S content, temperature and curing time. By observing the strength development of CG-RHA geopolymers for up to 90 days, it was found that elevated temperature curing was needed for these CG:RHA geopolymers to develop long-term strengths. Test results show that an optimum mix of CG:RHA:S 70:20:10 cured at 50 degrees C can achieve an Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of 2 MPa after 90 days of curing. The outcome of this research will enable CG, S and RHA waste products to be used as sustainable materials in pavement applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present work describes the production of novel highly hydrated cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) with unique morphology from coffee pulp waste using specific chemical treatments. The as-produced CMFs were successfully characterized and then used as an adsorbent for removal of methylene blue (MB) from concentrated aqueous solutions. Surprisingly, it was found that the novel CMFs display high water-uptake ability, with a maximum swelling ratio of 265{\%}, and that they form an entangled hydrated network gel in water. The morphological observation and nitrogen adsorption measurement demonstrated that the extracted CMFs exhibit an average fibril diameter of 11.5 mu m and mesoporous structure with an average pore size of 6.37 nm. These special features make the as-produced CMFs excellent candidates to be used as adsorbents for removal of MB from concentrated solutions. The performed adsorption studies determined that the adsorption equilibrium was reached within 90 min. The adsorption kinetics data were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherms were well described by the Freundlich isotherm model. In addition, the maximum adsorption capacity was 182.5 mg/g, much higher than that determined for other previously reported cellulose-based adsorbents. Through this study, we have demonstrated a possible strategy to give an added value to the coffee pulp waste, a by-product of the coffee processing industry, which is rich in cellulose, inexpensive and renewable source. Indeed, the extracted CMFs are very attractive for developing a sustainable and economically viable bio-sourced material for future growth of cellulose use in advanced applications.},

abstract = {Coffee pulp is a by-product of coffee processing representing about 40{\%} by weight of the ripe coffee fruit. In this paper results of coffee pulp pressing experiments are presented and discussed. Pressing trials were carried out with a batch hydraulic press and evaluated by calculation of two parameters, juice yield and extracted solids. Several pretreatments, before pulp pressing, were experimented with, among which were agitation, heating with live steam and adding commercial pectic enzymes. The major chemical components of the juice were analysed in all samples. It has been shown that juice yields close to 60{\%} of the initial fresh weight of pulp can be obtained, extracting with it about 35{\%} of the total solids present, if a combination of pectic enzyme and temperature is employed as pretreatment. The above figures are reduced to 35{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively when there are no pretreatments before pressing. The juice has about 14 Brix, 75{\%} of the total hot water extractable sugars present in fresh coffee pulp, all of the polyphenols, about 50{\%} of the nitrogen and 30{\%} of the caffeine. It can be employed as a raw material for microbial biomass production. The residual solid has a final moisture content of about 70{\%} which makes the material suitable for further composting or ensilage. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, thus being a rather relevant food commodity from an economic standpoint. In the coffee processing chain, from plant to cup, a series of by-products are generated in significant amounts with the major ones being husks, parchment husks, chaff (silverskin), and spent coffee ground (SCGs). Currently, these by-products are being underutilized in low-cost applications, e.g., ingredients for animal feed, substrate for composting and vermicomposting, and feedstock for in-farm or coffee industry combustion systems. The knowledge of the physical state and the chemical composition of each specific by-product is essential to define a path for its adequate exploitation. Coffee production and processing by-products present distinct physical and chemical characteristics, however, with a common distribution of classes of compounds among them, with carbohydrates comprising the major fraction, followed by proteins, lipids, ashes, polyphenols and caffeine. Thus, all the by-products are suitable for further profitable exploitation with current proposals for such valorization encompassing recovery of potential food ingredients, recovery and production of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, production of composite materials and films, production of adsorbents and catalysts, and production of biofuels. Thus, a critical overview of the current proposals is herein presented and future directions are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the present study, biochar from spent coffee grounds was synthesized via pyrolysis at 850 degrees C for 1 h, characterized and employed as catalyst for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by persulfate activation. A variety of techniques, such as physisorption of N-2, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and potentiometric mass titration, were employed for biochar characterization. The biochar has a surface area of 492 m(2)/g, its point of zero charge is 6.9, while mineral deposits are limited. SMX degradation experiments were performed mainly in ultrapure water (UPW) at persulfate concentrations between 100 and 1000 mg/L, biochar concentrations between 50 and 200 mg/L, SMX concentrations between 500 and 2000 mu g/L and initial solution pH between 3 and 10. Real matrices, besides UPW, were also tested, namely bottled water (BW) and treated wastewater (WW), while synthetic solutions were prepared spiking UPW with bicarbonate, chloride, humic acid or alcohols. Almost complete removal of SMX can be achieved using 200 mg/L biochar and 1000 mg/L sodium persulfate (SPS) within 75 min. The presence of biochar is important for the degradation process, while the activity of the biochar increases linearly with SPS concentration. Degradation follows a pseudo-order kinetic model and the rate increases with increasing biochar concentration and decreasing SMX concentration. Although SMX adsorption onto the biochar surface is favored at acidic conditions, degradation proceeds equally fast regardless of the initial solution pH. Reactions in either real matrix are slower, resulting in 55{\%} SMX removal in 60 min for WW. Bicarbonate causes severe inhibition as only 45{\%} of SMX can be removed within 75 min in UPW. The addition of alcohol slightly inhibits degradation suggesting that the reaction pathway is either under electron transfer control or due to the generation of surface oxygen radicals with higher oxidation potential than the homogeneously produced radicals.},

The valorization of coffee pulp is very important since a large quantity of coffee pulp is produced during coffee processing. In this study, the coffee pulp was extracted using various solvents at different temperatures and times to maximize the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the extract. The total phenolic content was analyzed using Folin-Ciocalteu method, whereas the antioxidant activity was analyzed using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. It was found that the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the coffee pulp extract were strongly influenced by the extraction condition. The coffee pulp extract in powder form produced using a spray dryer also showed a high total phenolic content and a high antioxidant activity. The findings of this study showed that coffee pulp extract has great potential to be used as a source of antioxidants for various products such as foods, beverages, and herbals. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {For the first time the volatile fraction of coffee silverskin has been studied focusing on odor-active compounds detected by gas chromatography-olfactometry/flame ionization detector (GC-O/FID) system. Two approaches, namely headspace (HS) analysis by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) and odor-active compounds analysis by gas chromatography-olfactometry/flame ionization detector (GC-O/FID), have been employed to fully characterize the aroma profile of this by-product. This work also provided an entire characterization of the bioactive compounds present in coffee silverskin, including alkaloids, chlorogenic acids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and secoiridoids, by using different extraction procedures and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system. Coffee silverskin was shown to be a good source of caffeine and chlorogenic acids but also of phenolic acids and flavonoids. In addition, the fatty acid composition of the coffee silverskin was established by GC-FID system. The results from this research could contribute to the development of innovative applications and reuses of coffee silverskin, an interesting resource with a high potential to be tapped by the food and nutraceutical sector, and possibly also in the cosmetics and perfumery.},

abstract = {Effects of supplementing sheep consuming wheat straw with local agro-industrial by-products on feed intake, growth, digestibility and nitrogen utilization were determined. Thirty 1-year-old local wethers, with a mean (+/-SD) live weight of 19.8 (+/-1.06) kg, were assigned to five treatments: wheat straw + atella (T1), wheat straw + atella + poultry litter (T2), wheat straw + atella + coffee pulp (T3), wheat straw + atella + coffee pulp + poultry litter (T4), hay + concentrate (T5). A 7-day digestibility experiment and a 112-day growth trial were conducted. Total dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) intake as well as body weight gain was similar for all treatments. The highest (P{\textless}0.05) nitrogen (N) intake was in sheep fed T1 and T4 diets, while the lowest was in those fed T2 and T5 diets. Sheep fed T1 and T2 diets had greater (P{\textless}0.05) DM and OM digestibility than those fed T4 and T5 diets. The highest (P{\textless}0.05) digestibility of N was for the T2, T4, and T5 diets, while the lowest was for the T1 diet. The highest N retention was in T4 diet, whereas the lowest was in T3 diet. In conclusion, in urban and peri-urban areas where atella, poultry litter, or coffee pulp are available, smallholder farmers could feed the mixtures as a supplement to straw with a good performance without using concentrate feeds.},

abstract = {Worldwide 1.3 billion tons of food is being wasted yearly from production to household level. This is an alarming situation as this food wastes create not only environmental and health issues but also economic crisis. Interestingly these food wastes are rich sources of a wide variety of bioactive molecules. Modern methods and technologies have to be adopted to utilize these food wastes for their efficient conversion into value-added products. Rather than dumping or burning the food wastes, these can be exploited as new sources for the production of useful bioactive molecules, which in turn will reduce the food wastes effectively. The bioactives and biopolymers produced from food wastes will be cost-effective, which, will enhance the market requirement. This review summarizes the existing and advancements in the extraction of bioactive compounds from food waste andmicrobial fermentation of food waste into polymers and its applications.},

abstract = {Largely produced agri-food byproducts represent a sustainable and easily available source of phenolic compounds, such as lignins and tannins, endowed with potent antioxidant properties. We report herein the characterization of the antioxidant properties of nine plant-derived byproducts. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assays indicated the superior activity of pomegranate peels and seeds, grape pomace and pecan nut shell. An increase in the antioxidant potency was observed for most of the waste materials following a hydrolytic treatment, with the exception of the condensed tannin-rich pecan nut shell and grape pomace. UV-Vis and HPLC investigation of the soluble fractions coupled with the results from IR analysis and chemical degradation approaches on the whole materials allowed to conclude that the improvement of the antioxidant properties was due not only to removal of non-active components (mainly carbohydrates), but also to structural modifications of the phenolic compounds. Parallel experiments run on natural and bioinspired model phenolic polymers suggested that these structural modifications positively impacted on the antioxidant properties of lignins and hydrolyzable tannins, whereas significant degradation of condensed tannin moieties occurred, likely responsible for the lowering of the reducing power observed for grape pomace and pecan nut shell. These results open new perspectives toward the exploitation and manipulation of agri-food byproducts for application as antioxidant additives in functional materials.},

abstract = {The present study focused on the application of pulsed electric fields (PEF) as an innovative pre-treatment technique to improve the recovery of polyphenols from two food by-products, cocoa bean shell (CBS) and coffee silver skin (CS). The effect of the different operating parameters on the extraction of polyphenols was optimised using the response surface methodology statistical approach. The optimised methodology was compared with conventional extraction and applied to several CBS and CS samples to classify the samples according to origin, variety and industrial treatment. PEF-assisted extraction had higher (approximately 20{\%}) recovery yields of polyphenols and methylxanthines than conventional extraction. Finally, the results highlighted that the composition of bioactive compounds from different extracts of CBS and CS and their antioxidant properties depended on the origin, variety and industrial processing of the raw material. These by-products may be a promising source of natural compounds, with potential applications on food and health sectors.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds collected from coffee bars (SCG-1) or recovered from coffee capsules (SCG-2) were investigated as a potential source of phenolic compounds and energy. Preliminary characterization of these materials provided a total phenolic content of 17.75 mg GAE/g for SCG-1 and 21.56 mg GAE/g for SCG-2. A solvent-extraction procedure using aqueous ethanol as the solvent and operating under mild temperature conditions was developed and tested. A two-level factorial design was used to study the effects of temperature (T = 30-50 degrees C), extraction time (E = 60-120 min), liquid-to-solid ratio (R = 20-40 mL/g) and ethanol concentration in the aqueous mixture (C = 30-70 vol{\%}) on the recovery of phenolic compounds. Under the best conditions, over 90{\%} of the phenolic compounds contained in the starting waste materials were recovered. T, R and C were the most influential factors and all of them had a positive effect on the extraction efficiency. The calorific values of the two coffee wastes were 23.72 MJ/kg (SCG-1) and 24.07 MJ/kg (SCG-2). They were only marginally affected by the extraction procedure, which supports the possibility of integrating the recovery of phenolic compounds with the use of the resulting solid residue to produce pellets or other agglomerates for heating purposes.

abstract = {In food and drink manufacturing, costs must be relentlessly minimised because margins for most products are low. At the same time, the business case for biorefining of lignocellulosic feedstocks has been positive in only a small number of cases. Since the two industries use similar feedstocks and processing equipment, there should be potential for significant sharing of resources for economic and environmental gain, particularly with regard to energy, if they were co-located. This paper reviews the nature, issues and opportunities for this sort of resource sharing between food industries and biorefineries. It then illustrates the opportunity by modelling a food product (coffee bean roasting) co-located with lignocellulosic biorefining of its downstream by-product (spent coffee grounds) where biofuels are not the target output, identifying and evaluating the resource efficiencies and economics involved. The analysis shows that there can be significant benefits, but that the exact nature of the food and biorefinery products and the biorefining pathways are the key dependencies. Further research should produce a comprehensive league table of co-location opportunities for the benefit of both industries to enhance both their economics and their sustainability metrics through well-targeted synergies.

abstract = {Promoting circularity in the aquaculture sector through the conversion of great amount of organic by-products produced on land is a valuable strategy for a further development of the aquaculture sector. In this regard, insects represent a very promising example of bio-converting organisms; their application in aquafeeds, however, still faces possible limitations because of their lack in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the presence of chitin. The aim of the present study was to apply circularity to Black Soldier Fly (BSF) (Hermetia illucens) culture and to improve the insect's biomass fatty acid composition by culturing them on a land-produced by-product (coffee silverskin) enriched with a 10{\%} Schizochytrium sp. The insect biomass was then used to formulate five fish diets containing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100{\%} of insect meal respect to fish meal, respectively. Diets were used for a feeding trial during zebrafish (Danio rerio) larval development (21 days) and a multidisciplinary approach including biometry, histology, gas chromatography, spectroscopy (FTIR), microbiota analyses and molecular biology was applied to better understand fish responses to the new diets. Results showed that the 50{\%} substitution of fish meal with insect meal represented the best compromise between ingredient sustainability and proper fish growth and welfare. Fish fed with higher BSF inclusions (75 and 100{\%}) showed a severe degree of hepatic steatosis, microbiota modification, a higher lipid content (FTIR), fatty acid modification and higher expression of both stress and immune response markers.},

abstract = {Background: Coffee silverskin, a by-product from coffee roasting industries, was evaluated as a feedstock for biobutanol production by acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation. This lignocellulosic biomass contained approximately 30{\%} total carbohydrates and 30{\%} lignin. Coffee silverskin was subjected to autohydrolysis at 170 °C during 20 min, with a biomass-to-solvent ratio of 20{\%}, and a subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial enzymes in order to release simple sugars. The fermentability of the hydrolysate was assessed with four solventogenic strains from the genus Clostridium. In addition, fermentation conditions were optimised via response surface methodology to improve butanol concentration in the final broth. Results: The coffee silverskin hydrolysate contained 34.39 ± 2.61 g/L total sugars, which represents a sugar recovery of 34 ± 3{\%}. It was verified that this hydrolysate was fermentable without the need of any detoxification method and that C. beijerinckii CECT 508 was the most efficient strain for butanol production, attaining final values of 4.14 ± 0.21 g/L acetone, 7.02 ± 0.27 g/L butanol and 0.25 ± 0.01 g/L ethanol, consuming 76.5 ± 0.8{\%} sugars and reaching a butanol yield of 0.269 ± 0.008 gB/gS under optimal conditions. Conclusions: Coffee silverskin could be an adequate feedstock for butanol production in biorefineries. When working with complex matrices like lignocellulosic biomass, it is essential to select an adequate bacterial strain and to optimize its fermentation conditions (such as pH, temperature or CaCO3 concentration).[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

This is clearly a very important issue and is the subject of the present work. Evidence is presented to support the conclusion that the economic performance of the process can be acceptable only at large production capacities realized at centralized facilities. In addition, it is shown, using a ``gate-to-gate{\{}''{\}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCI), that the environmental performance of the process is acceptable and the process can be considered sustainable. Further research is necessary in the area of efficient recovery of the bioactive compounds available in SCGs.

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) and coffee silverskins (CSS) are two high-volume industrial by-products rich in valuable components, such as alkaloids, diterpenic, and phenolic compounds, triglycerides (oils), and polysaccharides. Their recovery yield and purity are highly dependent on the selected extraction method and operating conditions. This chapter discusses recent advances on the following separation technologies: solid-liquid extraction (SLE) using conventional solvents and ionic liquids, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), subcritical water extraction, ultrasound assisted extraction, and microwave assisted extraction. SLE and SFE are the most mature approaches for the extraction of coffee by-products, although promising results have been reported for the other technologies. Solvents like ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents are expected to play an important role in the near future, along with other approaches, such as pervaporation, nanofiltration, sorption (adsorption and ion exchange), hydrothermal liquefaction, pulsed electric fields extraction, and products synthesis under the scope of nanotechnology. Overall, these methods produce oils/extracts rich in phenolic compounds exhibiting valuable antioxidant activity levels, with encouraging extraction yields. The optimization of both operating conditions and unit's arrangement is crucial to ensure their technological and economic viability. Currently, a considerable number of scientific studies and patents demonstrate or claim their use for various applications, including dermatological formulations, pest control formulations, growth enhancer substrates for bacterial cultures, biodiesel production, among others.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG), a processing by-product from the coffee industry, were evaluated as a potential feedstock for preparing agropellets for energy production. Hence, pure SCG and a SCG/sawdust blend were transformed into pellets. The latter thermal and chemical properties such as calorific value, ash content, bulk density, fixed carbon and elemental analysis were obtained. Thermogravimetric analyses were conducted in order to determine pyrolysis kinetics and combustion characteristics in order to study the agropellets performance. The obtained results show that SCG pellets thermal characteristics are in the same order as conventional biomasses such as sawdust. Moreover, blend 50{\%} SCG/50{\%} sawdust reaches the superior NF agropellets standard requirements which are essential to sell this agropellets in the French market. Analysis of the thermal degradation shows that SCG and its blend follow the usual behavior of lignocellulosic materials. Comparison of the combustion characteristics shows a higher reactivity of the blend comparing to pure SCG and sawdust. Such behavior might relate to heterogeneous structure and mutual interaction of the individual components of SCG and sawdust. Pyrolysis kinetics parameters obtained for SCG and SCG/sawdust blend are fairly close agreement with those found in literature for different biomasses. Hence SCG/sawdust may be a promising biofuel for the energy production in industrial applications. (c) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) generated after coffee extraction are the main byproduct of the coffee industry. Valorization of the SCG has been increasingly focused following considerable attention in coffee consumption. Lactic acid bacteria fermentation is the primary source of generation of lactic acid, a monomer of polylactic acid that has various industrial applications; however, because of the low tolerance of lactic acid bacteria to toxic compounds, it is necessary to apply Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce lactic acid whose tolerance to toxic compounds is higher. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using SCG as substrate for the production of lactic acid by S. cerevisiae strain expressing heterologous lactate dehydrogenase. The fermentation profiles of the engineered yeast showed that lactic acid production was promoted by xylose addition. From simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using a whole slurry of acid-pretreated SCG, containing high amounts of hemicellulose fractions, lactic acid (0.11 g) and ethanol (0.10 g) per g SCG were obtained after 24 h of SSF, of which yields were 413{\%} and 221{\%} higher, respectively, than those of washed pretreated SCG. Thus, fermentation of whole slurry SCG by engineered S. cerevisiae is a suitable way of lactic acid production, selectively.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CS), the main by-product in the coffee industry, contains a vast number of human health-related compounds, which may justify its exploitation as a functional food ingredient. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the polyphenolic and alkaloid profile through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis. The bioaccessibility of total phenolic compounds and changes in the antioxidant activity during an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were also evaluated through spectrophotometric tests (TPC by Folin-Ciocalteu, ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP), to elucidate their efficacy for future applications in the nutraceutical industry. Caffeoylquinic and feruloylquinic acids were the most representative polyphenols, with a mean concentration of 5.93 and 4.25 mg/g, respectively. Results showed a high content of caffeine in the analyzed CS extracts, with a mean value of 31.2 mg/g, meaning a two-fold increase when compared to coffee brews. Our findings highlighted that both the bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity of CS polyphenols significantly increased in each in vitro gastrointestinal digestion stage. In addition, the colon stage might constitute the main biological site of action of these antioxidant compounds. These results suggest that in vivo, the dietary polyphenols from CS might be metabolized by human colonic microflora, generating metabolites with a greater antioxidant activity, increasing their well-known beneficial effects.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin, the major coffee-roasting by-product, is currently used as fuel and for soil fertilization. However, there are several studies reporting silverskin as a good source of bioactive compounds that can be extracted and further used by cosmetic industry. Its high antioxidant potential may be due to the synergistic interaction of chlorogenic acids (1-6{\%}), caffeine (0.8-1.25{\%}), and melanoidins (17-23{\%}), among other antioxidant compounds. The bioactive compounds of silverskin can answer to the new fields of cosmetic industry on natural active ingredient resources that improve health skin appearance, counteract skin aging and related diseases, in an environmentally friendly approach. Skin aging is a complex process associated with oxidative metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. ROS production increase matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as well as pro-inflammatory mediators, resulting in consequent skin damage and aging. To counteract this process, cosmetic industry is looking for compounds able to increase MMP inhibitory activities, hyaluronidase inhibitory activity, expression of collagen and elastase inhibitory activity, as potential bioactive ingredients with anti-aging purposes. This review focuses on skin aging factors and the potential anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-cellulite and anti-hair loss activity, as well as protection against UV damage, of coffee silverskin and their bioactive compounds. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Hydroxycinnamic acids (HAs) have a potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industry because they are rich in phenolics. Feruloyl esterases release phenolic compounds from plant cell walls. Coffee pulp is rich in HAs linked to polysaccharides. A solvent extraction of free HAs was performed with aqueous methanol (80 {\%}). A response surface methodology was applied to optimise the extraction of these compounds from coffee pulp, and the best results were obtained at 56 °C for 34 min. Alkaline and acid hydrolyses were performed to evaluate the content of linked HAs. Treated (extracted) coffee pulp was used to produce feruloyl esterases in solid-state fermentation by Aspergillus tamarii V12307, previously selected by a hydrolysis plate assay. Different dilutions of a culture medium were added to the coffee pulp, and the diluted medium with half the nutrients allowed for higher CO2 production. A specific growth rate ($\mu$CO2) of 0.25 h-1 and a lag phase (tlag) of 14.3 h were observed under the selected conditions. Finally, enzymatic activities were 14.0 and 10.8 nkat per g of dried matter when methyl and ethyl ferulate were used as substrates, respectively. Productivities (9.3 and 7.2 nkat per g of dried matter per day, respectively) were higher when compared to other studies carried out in solid-state fermentation. Utilisation of coffee pulp for enzyme production improves the added value of this abundant by-product of the coffee industry.},

Since coffee is a very popular beverage worldwide, the coffee industry is responsible for generating large amounts of by-products, which include the coffee silverskin (CS), the only by-product of the roasting process. In this work, its characterization and food safety were evaluated by chemical composition assays, microbiological determinations, aflatoxin measurements and acute toxicity tests. The results showed that CS is safe for use in food, in addition to providing dietary fiber, protein and bioactive compounds. An extruded cereal-based ready-to-eat food product was developed through an extreme vertices mixture design, producing an extruded food product being a source of protein and with a high fiber content. Up to 15{\%} of CS was incorporated in the extruded product. This work contributes to the establishment of routes for the valorization of CS; nevertheless, further research is necessary to demonstrate the sustainability of this food industry by-product.},

The SCG extraction (SCGE) was irradiated at doses ranging between 30 and 50 kGy. The deep dark-brown color of SCGE was changed to a bright yellow color by gamma irradiation. The content of the bioactive compounds of gamma-irradiated SCGE was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Interestingly, the content of quinic acid was increased by gamma irradiation, whereas other compounds were decreased. Although the contents of bioactive compounds were changed by gamma irradiation, the biological activities (radical scavenging activity and whitening effects) of SCGE were unaffected. Our findings suggest that gamma irradiation can effectively improve the color values of SCGE without the loss of biological activities. Consequently, gamma irradiation can be a useful tool for improving the utilization of SCGE in the cosmetic industry.},

abstract = {Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages and the second largest traded product after petroleum. Coffee is produced around the globe in about 80 countries and interferes with huge business around the world. Coffee dispensation needs a high degree of processing know-how and produces large quantities of processing by-products such as coffee pulp and husk that have limited applications such as animal feed, fertilizer, compost, and so on. Biotechnological developments in industrial waste management are supporting the sustainable development of the economy of the country. The aims of food processing by-products, waste and effluents include recovering fine chemicals and developing useful metabolites through chemical and biotechnological processes. Pretreatments, accompanied by rehabilitation procedures, include value-added materials (natural antioxidants, enzymes, vitamins, cellulose, proteins, starch, lipids, and pigments) of great importance for the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries. With the backdrop of high crop production in coming years, it is imperative to counterpart this development with some use and industrial use of coffee byproducts as the coffee industry produces huge amounts of coffee by-products that are flourishing nutrient resources. The present analysis highlights value-added explorations of coffee by-products that can be accomplished by valuation strategy, incorporation of bioengineering principles techniques and applications in food processing and waste management and, secondly, conservation of environment with disposal issue improving both ecological and economic resources. {\textcopyright} 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

abstract = {Context: Coffee silverskin (CS), a food by-product of the coffee roasting industry, has been studied as an active ingredient for skin care products due to its high potential of antioxidant activity and low cytotoxicity. Another food waste used as ingredient with promising characteristics is obtained from Medicago sativa (MS), which antioxidants and isoflavones content is high. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate and characterize a new body formulation containing two food by-products extracts. Materials and methods: Different parameters (such as pH, rheological behavior, color, antioxidant content and microbiological analysis) of a body cream formulation containing by-products (CSMS) and a formulation without extracts (F) were evaluated under a stability study during 180 days at different temperatures. Moreover, the in vitro cell toxicity and the in vivo skin safety and protective effects were also assessed. Results: Formulation showed stable physical properties and antioxidant activity during 180 days of storage. In vitro toxicity was screened in two skin cell lines (fibroblasts and keratinocytes) and any toxicity was reported. The in vivo test carried out showed that, with respect to irritant effects, CSMS formulation can be regarded as safe for topical application and the skin hydratation improved after 30 days of its use. Also, considering the consumer acceptance, more than 90{\%} of volunteers classified it as very pleasant. Conclusions: CSMS formulation is stable and safe for topical use as no adverse and/or side effects were observed during the application period of testing, improving skin protective properties.},

abstract = {In coffee-producing countries, waste products from coffee production are useful substrates for cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus. This species is relatively easy to grow, coffee waste substrates are readily available and the mushroom fruiting bodies are a valuable source of nutrition and income. In developed countries, cultivation of P. ostreatus on spent coffee grounds (SCG) from coffee consumption is a novel way to recycle this urban waste product. Here, we studied the effect of SCG and caffeine on growth of a commercial strain of P. ostreatus in liquid and solid cultures, and on a commercial scale. The presence of caffeine inhibited mycelial growth on agar and in liquid culture in the laboratory. Increased levels of SCG in an SCG/sawdust substrate also delayed mycelial growth and delayed or prevented fruiting during commercial cultivation. Despite growth inhibition, partial degradation of caffeine to xanthine by P. ostreatus mycelium was observed in all SCG-containing substrate mixtures. Degradation of caffeine proceeded mainly via sequential N-demethylation to theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) and 3-methylxanthine, although both paraxanthine and theobromine also accumulated in the substrate. Caffeine and its demethylated metabolites were also detected in fruiting bodies, but it was not clear whether caffeine metabolism occurred in the fruiting bodies themselves or whether caffeine metabolites were translocated there from the mycelium. Based on the caffeine concentrations measured in fruiting bodies after growth with SCG, it would be necessary to consume 250kg of fresh oyster mushrooms to obtain the amount of caffeine equivalent to one cup of espresso coffee, suggesting that the health impact of caffeine in these mushrooms is low. However, the ability of P. ostreatus to degrade caffeine indicates that this and other species in this genus may have potential applications in detoxification of coffee production wastes.},
