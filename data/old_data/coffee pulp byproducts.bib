abstract = {Hydroxycinnamic acids (HAs) have a potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industry because they are rich in phenolics. Feruloyl esterases release phenolic compounds from plant cell walls. Coffee pulp is rich in HAs linked to polysaccharides. A solvent extraction of free HAs was performed with aqueous methanol (80 {\%}). A response surface methodology was applied to optimise the extraction of these compounds from coffee pulp, and the best results were obtained at 56 °C for 34 min. Alkaline and acid hydrolyses were performed to evaluate the content of linked HAs. Treated (extracted) coffee pulp was used to produce feruloyl esterases in solid-state fermentation by Aspergillus tamarii V12307, previously selected by a hydrolysis plate assay. Different dilutions of a culture medium were added to the coffee pulp, and the diluted medium with half the nutrients allowed for higher CO2 production. A specific growth rate ($\mu$CO2) of 0.25 h-1 and a lag phase (tlag) of 14.3 h were observed under the selected conditions. Finally, enzymatic activities were 14.0 and 10.8 nkat per g of dried matter when methyl and ethyl ferulate were used as substrates, respectively. Productivities (9.3 and 7.2 nkat per g of dried matter per day, respectively) were higher when compared to other studies carried out in solid-state fermentation. Utilisation of coffee pulp for enzyme production improves the added value of this abundant by-product of the coffee industry.},

In the last years, some research has demonstrated that this type of biomass can be a good source of bioproducts through its transformation using stand-alone processes or biorefineries. In this sense, this chapter shows a description of coffee grain and an overview of the world production, consumption, and processing stages to obtain the by-products. In order to know the potential and identify the important compounds in the coffee processing, the physicochemical composition of by-products is analyzed. Thus, an analysis of possibilities of integral valorization of by-products as raw materials to obtain antioxidants, biofuels, bioenergy, bioproducts, and biofertilizers is performed. Finally, the biorefinery concept is considered to generate biochemicals and added-value products from the abovementioned residues, taking into account the design of biorefineries, the production scale, and a technical and economic assessment.},

For this purpose, we have reviewed the literature on the composition and safety of coffee flowers, leaves, pulp, husk, parchment, green coffee, silver skin, and spent coffee grounds. Some of these products have a history of consumption in Europe (green coffee), while others have already been used as traditional food in non-EU-member countries (coffee leaves, notification currently pending), or an application for authorization as novel food has already been submitted (husks, flour from spent coffee grounds). For the other products, toxicity and/or safety data appear to be lacking, necessitating further studies to fulfill the requirements of novel food applications.},

abstract = {Currently, many research studies are being carried out on the production of alcohol from lignocellulosic biomasses. In this study, the ethanol obtained from a mixture of coffee pulp and mucilage, commercial baker's yeast and panela (dehydrated and solidified cane juice) was evaluated. The pulp and mucilage of coffee underwent an acid hydrolysis, and the wort (pulp juice and mucilage) was fermented with an inoculum of exponential phase Saccharomyces cerevisiae and commercial whole panela. The fermented product was distilled, and the gas chromatographic analysis showed an ethanol yield of 25.44 kg/m3, resulting from the 64.40 kg/m3of total sugars, such yield is equivalent to 77.29{\%} of the theoretical yield. This fact shows that the production of ethanol is viable in small coffee farms using readily available raw materials. The stillage was analyzed and it presented the following values: 0.40 ppm (Iron), 0.97 ppm (Magnesium), 1.54 ppm (Calcium), and 4.40 ppm (Phosphorus). The results confirm that they are particularly useful as a complement in the production of bio-fertilizers for earthworms.},

abstract = {The tradition in Colombia of processing coffee in each farm provides a source of residual biomass (coffee pulp) with a potential for transformation into synthesis gas through the process of biomass gasification, since 40{\%} of the weight of the harvested coffee is fresh pulp. The conceptual design, construction and commissioning of a downstream biomass gasifier was carried out with the aim of using coffee pulp as the source of biomass as it is readily available on all coffee farms. During the operation of the gasifier, the process gives rise to a combustible gas and biochar. The latter can be used for soil amelioration, in the coffee plantation, as well as being a means of sequestering atmospheric carbon. After the process of mechanical separation, the coffee pulp was submitted to solar drying after which it presented a uniform particle size, between 2 and 3 mm, ideal for use in fixed bed gasifiers. In this study, the coffee pulp was compared with two other sources of biomass; rice hulls and “cisco” (the outer skin of the coffee bean available from coffee processing factories. While the gasifier operates, the fuel gas is thermally harnessed through a heat exchanger, which heats the air stream to a constant temperature of 50 °C. The hot air is supplied to a traditional coffee dryer, where the coffee grains are dried to 12{\%} humidity for further packaging and marketing. It was evident during the tests that the gasifier needed a stabilization time to obtain a stream of stable and combustible synthesis gas. The dried coffee pulp produced a synthesis gas of more uniform quality as compared with the rice husks and the coffee husks. The time to stabilise the gas flow and the rate of consumption of biomass also favoured the use of coffee pulp compared with the other feedstocks. By contrast, the relative production rate of biochar was higher for rice husk compared with coffee pulp and cisco” which did not differ. The quality of the biochar, as indicated by its capacity to absorb water was also highest for the rice husk biochar. The coffee pulp was associated with a minimum degree of obstruction of the pipes by tar, in contrast to the coffee husks that produced more tar. Biochar contamination of the synthesis gas stream was also apparent when the fuel was rice husks or coffee husks due to their lower density compared to the coffee pulp. {\textcopyright} 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

Our results demonstrated that substitution of pro-mix by 10{\%} coffee pulp compost significantly increased aerial biomass, seedling height and number of nodes per plant. Substitution of pro-mix with 10 and 50{\%} coffee pulp compost increased seedling height by 20 and 4{\%}, respectively, compared to pure pro-mix media. Unamended peat moss and peat moss substituted with lower rate (10{\%}) of compost gave the lowest result in all response variables assessed.

In conclusion, substitution of Pro-mix media with coffee pulp compost up to 50{\%} and amendment of top soil with 5 and 10{\%} CPCG were found to be a good option for greenhouse/nursery tomato seedling production and field production of tomato, respectively. Furthermore, the possibility of managing coffee byproducts by utilization is demonstrated.

The valorization of coffee pulp is very important since a large quantity of coffee pulp is produced during coffee processing. In this study, the coffee pulp was extracted using various solvents at different temperatures and times to maximize the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the extract. The total phenolic content was analyzed using Folin-Ciocalteu method, whereas the antioxidant activity was analyzed using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. It was found that the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the coffee pulp extract were strongly influenced by the extraction condition. The coffee pulp extract in powder form produced using a spray dryer also showed a high total phenolic content and a high antioxidant activity. The findings of this study showed that coffee pulp extract has great potential to be used as a source of antioxidants for various products such as foods, beverages, and herbals. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Coffee husk and coffee pulp are coffee processing by-products. Coffee husk is obtained when harvested coffee is processed by the dry method, and coffee pulp is produced by the wet method. In Brazil, coffee is usually processed by the dry method, therefore an expressive amount of husk is obtained every year. Some of the husk is used as organic fertilizer but, other applications are very limited, mainly because it is a bulky product. The presence of tannins and caffeine diminish acceptability and palatability of husk by animals. This review discuss degradation of caffeine by microorganisms, with special attention to bacterial, biological decaffeination of coffee husk and pulp and its subsequent use on animal feeding. The known biochemical routes of caffeine degradation by microorganisms are initially discussed; problems concerning physiological effects in animals, focusing on the limitations imposed by caffeine as an antiphysiological component are raised; the use of microorganisms to decaffeinate coffee husk and pulp is discussed. The discussions offer a view on decreasing caffeine content of coffee husk and pulp, which would allow the use of larger amounts of these products in animal feeding, partially replacing traditional components such as cereal grains. {\textcopyright} 2002, Scientia Agricola.

abstract = {This research focuses on the removal of contaminants from wastewaters as a matter of great interest in the field of water pollution. the first decades of the 21st century have brought numerous approaches for the development of cheaper and more effective adsorbents capable of eliminating heavy metals. the study aims to examine the way coffee pulp (Castilla variety from Caldas, Colombia) was used as a bioadsorbent for the removal of Mn (II) from synthetic wastewater to fulfill goals 3 and 6 proposed in the Sustainable Development Goals stated for the 2030 Agenda, particularly in Sections 3.9 and 6.9. In order to achieve this objective, the agricultural residue was subjected to bromatological characterization, determination of the lignocellulosic composition, and identification of characteristic organic functional groups through IR spectrophotometry, using the ATR (attenuated total reflection) technique. Additionally, the optimal parameters for contaminant removal were identified, regarding the biomass quantity, the optimum pH, the stirring time, the adsorption kinetics, the zero charge potential (pHpzc), the adsorption isotherms, and the explanation of the possible adsorption mechanisms between the contaminant, the surface of the coffee pulp, and the capacity of maximum adsorption. the results show that lignocellulosic material presented a cellulose content of 29.93 - 0.21{\%} and a lignin content of 19.25 - 0.16{\%}. the optimum parameters found were as follows: Particle size of 180 $\mu$m, contact time from 90 min to 100 RPM, optimum pH of 4.0 pH units, room temperature; the kinetic model adjusted to the bioadsorption process was Ho and McKay's pseudo-second-order, under an isotherm of the Langmuir model, for which the removal presented was 53.40{\%}, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 8.01 mg g-1. Finally, the novelty of the reported research consists of using coffee pulp as a bioadsorbent without chemical modification, for the removal of heavy metals, in this case Mn (II), in industrial wastewater, which would be another application of this coffee by-product. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {Coffee pulp is a by-product of coffee processing representing about 40{\%} by weight of the ripe coffee fruit. In this paper results of coffee pulp pressing experiments are presented and discussed. Pressing trials were carried out with a batch hydraulic press and evaluated by calculation of two parameters, juice yield and extracted solids. Several pretreatments, before pulp pressing, were experimented with, among which were agitation, heating with live steam and adding commercial pectic enzymes. The major chemical components of the juice were analysed in all samples. It has been shown that juice yields close to 60{\%} of the initial fresh weight of pulp can be obtained, extracting with it about 35{\%} of the total solids present, if a combination of pectic enzyme and temperature is employed as pretreatment. The above figures are reduced to 35{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively when there are no pretreatments before pressing. The juice has about 14 Brix, 75{\%} of the total hot water extractable sugars present in fresh coffee pulp, all of the polyphenols, about 50{\%} of the nitrogen and 30{\%} of the caffeine. It can be employed as a raw material for microbial biomass production. The residual solid has a final moisture content of about 70{\%} which makes the material suitable for further composting or ensilage. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

Coffee dispensation needs a high degree of processing know-how and produces large quantities of processing by-products such as coffee pulp and husk that have limited applications such as animal feed, fertilizer, compost, and so on. Biotechnological developments in industrial waste management are supporting the sustainable development of the economy of the country. The aims of food processing by-products, waste and effluents include recovering fine chemicals and developing useful metabolites through chemical and biotechnological processes. Pretreatments, accompanied by rehabilitation procedures, include value-added materials (natural antioxidants, enzymes, vitamins, cellulose, proteins, starch, lipids, and pigments) of great importance for the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries. With the backdrop of high crop production in coming years, it is imperative to counterpart this development with some use and industrial use of coffee byproducts as the coffee industry produces huge amounts of coffee by-products that are flourishing nutrient resources. The present analysis highlights value-added explorations of coffee by-products that can be accomplished by valuation strategy, incorporation of bioengineering principles techniques and applications in food processing and waste management and, secondly, conservation of environment with disposal issue improving both ecological and economic resources. {\textcopyright} 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

abstract = {Wet coffee pulp (WCP), produced as waste from coffee production, is a rich source of bioactive compounds, especially caffeine and chlorogenic acid. However, it contains high moisture content, thus it is challenging for further utilization due to degradation and microbial deterioration. Dehydration is, therefore, necessary to minimize degradation and ease storage and transportation. As a waste, the common drying methods should be prioritized to be feasible for industrial application. This study aimed to determine the impact of different drying conditions of the three common drying methods including low temperature and pressure, vacuum and hot air drying on physical, phytochemical and antioxidant properties of WCP to identify the most suitable drying conditions. Browning index, moisture content, total phenolic content (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), proanthocyanidins, and chlorogenic acid as well as the antioxidant properties of the dried coffee pulp were significantly influenced by different tested conditions. Vacuum drying was found to be more suitable for drying the wet coffee pulp as compared to low temperature and pressure and hot air drying methods. Vacuum drying at 110 °C retained the highest TPC (14.4 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry weight (DW)), proanthocyanidins (6.8 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/g DW), TFC (13.2 CE/g DW), caffeine (2.9 mg/g DW) and antioxidant capacity. Chlorogenic acid (3.4 mg/g DW) was 13{\%} lower, but energy consumption was 37{\%} less than vacuum drying at 90 °C. Therefore, vacuum drying (3.75 mmHg) at 110 °C for 4h 05 min was suggested for dehydration of the wet coffee pulp for subsequent recovery and processing. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {Coffee pulp represents 40{\%} of the total weight of the berry. Pressing this by-product for further utilization yields a sugar-rich effluent juice which has been considered as raw material for the production of biogas. Experiments with one- and two-phase anaerobic systems were performed. Loading rates for the one-phase methanogenic reactor ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}5 to 3 g Volatile Solids liter-1 day-1, with hydraulic retention times of 10 days. When separated acidogenic and methanogenic digesters were used, the first phase was operated at 0{\textperiodcentered}5 days HRT and a load of 56 g Volatile Solids liter-1 day-1, while the retention times for the second phase ranged from 10 to 5 days, with loads of 0{\textperiodcentered}6 to 2{\textperiodcentered}4 g Volatile Solids liter-1 day-1. It was concluded, from the results of the experiments, that a two-phase anaerobic digestion system is better for treating coffee pulp juice than a one-phase unit. Hydraulic retention times of 0{\textperiodcentered}5 days for the acidogenic phase and 8 days for the methanogenic seem to produce stable conditions, when daily Volatile Solids loads are of the order of 55 g liter-1 and 1{\textperiodcentered}8 g liter-1, respectively. 1{\textperiodcentered}8 g liter-1, respectively. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important commodities worldwide. The industrial processing of coffee cherries generates a considerable volume of by-products such as wastewater, coffee pulp, mucilage, and husk. These by-products have sugars and nutrients that can be converted into value-added products via microbial action. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated the potential of coffee pulp and coffee wastewater as substrate for alcoholic fermentation produce a distilled beverage. The must composed by dry or wet coffee pulp and coffee wastewater added of commercial sucrose or sugarcane molasses was fermented by S. cerevisiae. After a screening step, a larger fermentation was carried out with the wet pulp added of sucrose due to its higher alcoholic fermentation efficiency. The distilled beverage contained 38{\%} (v/v) ethanol and 0.2 g/L of acetic acid. The contaminants furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural and ethyl carbamate were below detection level. Among the 48 volatile compounds detected, the majority (21) were ethyl esters usually associated with floral and sweet aromas. Ethyl decanoate (996.88 mu g/L) and ethyl dodecanoate (1088.09 mu g/L) were the most abundant esters. Coffee spirit presented taste acceptance of 80{\%} and sugarcane spirit, 70{\%}. The tasters indicated an aroma acceptance of 86{\%} for the coffee spirit and 78{\%} for the sugarcane spirit. The results of this work demonstrate the potential for using coffee by-products to produce a good quality distilled beverage. Considering our results, especially sensorial analysis, we can infer that the produced coffee beverage represents a new alternative for adding value to the coffee production chain.},

abstract = {Coffee is the second traded food commodity in the world. Beyond roasted seeds, the most part of the original fruit-and in particular pulp- is discarded as waste, with severe environmental and economic consequences in many developing countries. Our research focused on developing an eco-friendly extraction protocol of phyto-complexes from coffee pulp and evaluating their bioactivity and beneficial effects to human health as food supplements. Antioxidant activity assays (Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH assays) were adopted to select the most effective extraction technique and results show antioxidant activity of coffee pulp extracts. After analysis of cytotoxicity on human epithelial gastric cells, measurements of IL-8 release of treated or pre-treated cells were performed. Results showed that the use of soft technical equipment and sustainable solvents (i.e. maceration process, aqueous extraction) can extract phytocomplexes with antioxidant properties. Moreover, IL-8 measurements showed impairment of this chemokine release at concentrations that may be reached in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract, following consumption of reasonable amount of extract. Pre-treatments analysis demonstrated the ability of coffee pulp extracts to prevent IL-8 release by gastric epithelial cells. Chemical evaluation performed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry showed that quinic acid derivatives are abundant in coffee pulp extract together with procyanidins derivatives: those compounds might be responsible for the high biological activity. This evidence supports future applications of coffee pulp extracts as food supplement with high added value, starting from a waste that can be valorized through simple yet efficient extraction methods.},

abstract = {The present work describes the production of novel highly hydrated cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) with unique morphology from coffee pulp waste using specific chemical treatments. The as-produced CMFs were successfully characterized and then used as an adsorbent for removal of methylene blue (MB) from concentrated aqueous solutions. Surprisingly, it was found that the novel CMFs display high water-uptake ability, with a maximum swelling ratio of 265{\%}, and that they form an entangled hydrated network gel in water. The morphological observation and nitrogen adsorption measurement demonstrated that the extracted CMFs exhibit an average fibril diameter of 11.5 mu m and mesoporous structure with an average pore size of 6.37 nm. These special features make the as-produced CMFs excellent candidates to be used as adsorbents for removal of MB from concentrated solutions. The performed adsorption studies determined that the adsorption equilibrium was reached within 90 min. The adsorption kinetics data were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherms were well described by the Freundlich isotherm model. In addition, the maximum adsorption capacity was 182.5 mg/g, much higher than that determined for other previously reported cellulose-based adsorbents. Through this study, we have demonstrated a possible strategy to give an added value to the coffee pulp waste, a by-product of the coffee processing industry, which is rich in cellulose, inexpensive and renewable source. Indeed, the extracted CMFs are very attractive for developing a sustainable and economically viable bio-sourced material for future growth of cellulose use in advanced applications.},

In food and related industry, major importance was being attached to the use of enzymes in upgrading quality, increasing yields of extractive processes, product stabilization, and improvement of flavor and byproduct utilization. Pectinases or pectinolytic enzymes are today one of the upcoming enzymes of the commercial sector. It has been reported that microbial pectinases account for 25{\%} of the global food enzymes sales. For this reason, this study was undertaken with aims of screening microorganisms for the pectinase activity from coffee pulp samples and molecular identification of the potential pectinolytic isolates. In the present investigation, in total, ninetyfive (95) isolates were identified from thirty coffee pulp samples. Based on characterization on the selective growth media, the isolates were grouped as actinomycete (21.06{\%}), bacteria (65.26{\%}), and fungi (13.68{\%}). Among these, 31.58{\%} showed colonies surrounded by clear zones which indicate the presence of pectinase activity. After rigorous screening steps, the isolates with high potential pectinase activity were identified molecularly by sequencing 16S rDNA region of the isolates. Based on the molecular identifications, about 70{\%} of the isolates are under genus Bacillus.},

abstract = {Background. The main by-product of the coffee production chain is pulp; if it is not properly disposed of, it represents a serious environmental problem. Some studies suggest that this pulp can be used as a source of important compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the content of bioactive compounds present in coffee pulps and also to prepare a functional drink-type infusion to propose an alternative use of this by-product. Material and methods. In coffee pulps (Coffea arabica, var. Colombia and Caturra), the effect of the temperature and the extraction type over the content of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, condensed tannins and phenolic acids were determined. Moreover, the antioxidant activity by ABTS, ORAC and FRAP methodologies. With the best pulp, an infusion-type hot drink was prepared at 80 degrees C. Finally, sensory assessment was performed. Results. The best conditions to perform the metabolite extraction were room temperature and HC1 1{\%}. The highest trapping capacity of the cationic radical ABTS(+){\{}*{\}} was 24 782.93 mu mol Trolox Equivalent per 100 g of pulp, ORAC 57 087.82 mu mol Trolox Equivalent per 100 g of pulp and FRAP 806.93 mg of ascorbic acid equivalent per 100 g of pulp. For the infusion preparation, two drying methods were used - stove and lyophilization, and overall the best results correspond to the infusions prepared with the lyophilized plant material. This material also had good overall scores in the sensory test (3.51 to 4.04 on a scale of 1 to 5) been the taste most appreciated by the panelists. Conclusion. The bioactive compound concentration and the antioxidant activity of the coffee pulp suggest that waste can be used as a raw material for the preparation of functional foods, because the values found are similar or greater than those found in other drinks and fruits consumed commercially.},

abstract = {The semi-dry processing of coffee generates significant amounts of coffee pulp and wastewater. This study evaluated the production of bioethanol and volatile compounds of eight yeast strains cultivated in a mixture of these residues. Hanseniaspora uvarum UFLA CAF76 showed the best fermentation performance; hence it was selected to evaluate different culture medium compositions and inoculum size. The best results were obtained with 12{\%} w/v of coffee pulp, 1 g/L of yeast extract and 0.3 g/L of inoculum. Using these conditions, fermentation in 1 L of medium was carried out, achieving higher ethanol yield, productivity and efficiency with values of 0.48 g/g, 0.55 g/L h and 94.11{\%} respectively. Twenty-one volatile compounds corresponding to higher alcohols, acetates, terpenes, aldehydes and volatile acids were identified by GC-FID. Such results indicate that coffee residues show an excellent potential as substrates for production of value-added compounds. H. uvarum demonstrated high fermentative capacity using these residues.

abstract = {Some productive processes allow the utilization of by-products, waste or residues generated in other different processes. From the point of view of the sustainable development, this is interesting because, on the one hand, the resources are to be useful to the maximum, and for other one, the waste disposal decreases. A good example is the use of a great variety of agricultural crop residues and agroindustrial by-products as substrates in the production of edible mushrooms. Mushroom cultivation is an efficient biotechnological process, since high performances and good productivity are achieved with low environmental controls. Mushrooms grow in a wide range of temperature, in short periods and has the ability of biodegrade different lignocellulosic substrates. This makes possible the valorization of agricultural, forest and agroindustrial residues regionally available. In Mexico, mushroom cultivation is an important economic and ecological activity, because it generates employments and enables the use and recycling of more than 500,000 tons of agricultural, agroindustrial and forest residues, per year. Moreover, it reduces the environmental impact of the final disposition of green residues. The goal of this work is to present a review of the research, mainly in Ibero-American countries, about the utilization of different green wastes (substrates) on the cultivation and production of edible mushrooms (Pleurotus spp.). Substrates were classified as straw, stubble, pulp, bagasse, forest residues, and others. The wide variation of biological efficiency (BE) (15 {\%} - 235 {\%}) obtained in different studies, and the criteria needed to choose the correct substrate for the cultivation of mushrooms were also analyzed.},

abstract = {The present study considers the establishment of a biomass gasification model using for its validation, experimental data obtained in a 15-20 kg/h coffee pulp downdraft gasifier unit, operated at ICAFE-Costa Rica. The gasification model proposed considers a heterogeneous ``downflow{\{}''{\}} central section and a homogeneous ``upflow{\{}''{\}} exit section, both operating at chemical equilibrium. Each of the sections includes a number of relevant independent chemical reactions. Biomass is incorporated into the model using its elemental composition as well as its water content. Different reaction paths are examined in order to analyze the applicability of the various assumptions considered. The established model accounts for biochar thermodynamic properties as well as gasifier operating temperatures in the homogenous ``upflow{\{}''{\}} section, using a numerical fitting method. With this approach, the proposed model successfully predicts the molar fractions of various syngas components, most notably, the CH4 and H-2 fractions via the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, as well as the carbon converted. It is anticipated that the developed model will provide a valuable simulation and design tool for scaled-up downdraft biomass gasifiers.},

abstract = {Extracellular esterase activity was detected in submerged cultures of Rhizoctonia solani grown in the presence of sugar beet pectin or Tween 80. Putative type B feruloyl esterase (FAE) coding sequences found in the genome data of the basidiomycete were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant enzyme production on the 5-L bioreactor scale (Rs pCAE: 3245 U L-1) exceeded the productivity of the wild type strain by a factor of 800. Based on substrate specificity profiling, the purified recombinant Rs pCAE was classified as a p-coumaroyl esterase (pCAE) with a pronounced chlorogenic acid esterase side activity. The Rs pCAE was also active on methyl cinnamate, caffeate and ferulate and on feruloylated saccharides. The unprecedented substrate profile of Rs pCAE together with the lack of sequence similarity to known FAEs or pCAEs suggested that the Rs pCAE represents a new type of enzyme. Hydroxycinnamic acids were released from agro-industrial side-streams, such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB), sugar beet pectin (SBP) and coffee pulp (CP). Overnight incubation of coffee pulp with the Rs pCAE resulted in the efficient release of p-coumaric (100{\%}), caffeic (100{\%}) and ferulic acid (85{\%}) indicating possible applications for the valorization of food processing wastes and for the enhanced degradation of lignified biomass.

After coffee processing only 5.8{\%} of the total matter is used for coffee production generating a large amount of waste, were no commercial value, that can hardly pollute the environment. The coffee husk conservation can be made by silage. Specific microorganisms can produce a standard ensilage when added in the process. The main goal of this work is to study the natural microflora present in the coffee husk and coffee pulp able to ensilage these by-products. The lactic acid bacteria responsible for this process were isolated and characterised and added in an ensilage process to accelerate the acid lactic production. First, in this work, fresh fruity coffee pulp were put fermented naturally and it was observed that the pH was maintained around 4 during two months. Then many bacteria were isolated from these natural fermented materials. Morphology, fermentative and biochemistry studies were used to identify and characterise the bacteria. These bacteria were able to grown in a coffee extract and change the pH 6 to around 4.4. Then, the second study was added these isolated bacteria in processed coffee husk to ensilage. It shows that is necessary to add the lactic acid bacteria to initiate the ensilage process. In the coffee husk fermentation, 10(7) CFU were added per g of matter and the pH was maintained around 4.8; microorganisms were viable for 2 months.},

Thirty 1-year-old local wethers, with a mean (+/-SD) live weight of 19.8 (+/-1.06) kg, were assigned to five treatments: wheat straw + atella (T1), wheat straw + atella + poultry litter (T2), wheat straw + atella + coffee pulp (T3), wheat straw + atella + coffee pulp + poultry litter (T4), hay + concentrate (T5). A 7-day digestibility experiment and a 112-day growth trial were conducted. Total dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) intake as well as body weight gain was similar for all treatments. The highest (P{\textless}0.05) nitrogen (N) intake was in sheep fed T1 and T4 diets, while the lowest was in those fed T2 and T5 diets. Sheep fed T1 and T2 diets had greater (P{\textless}0.05) DM and OM digestibility than those fed T4 and T5 diets. The highest (P{\textless}0.05) digestibility of N was for the T2, T4, and T5 diets, while the lowest was for the T1 diet. The highest N retention was in T4 diet, whereas the lowest was in T3 diet. In conclusion, in urban and peri-urban areas where atella, poultry litter, or coffee pulp are available, smallholder farmers could feed the mixtures as a supplement to straw with a good performance without using concentrate feeds.},

The qualitative analysis showed no significant differences between the raw and the fermented pulps. Free hydroxycinnamic acids (HAs) were mainly chlorogenic acids, with 5-caffeoylquinic acid as the major compound. Bound HAs released caffeic acids during alkaline hydrolysis, and no bound ferulic and p-coumaric acids were detected. The fermentation process allowed the detoxification of the pulp from caffeine by 50{\%}, while significantly reducing the amounts of residue by 64{\%}. Moreover, the fermented products could be further processed to provide high added-value molecules with potential industrial applications, providing a new source of income for the small coffee producers.},

abstract = {Agro-industrial processing always generates waste materials. Coffee is one of the largest commodities in the world, and its processing yields coffee husk as waste by-product. Its disposal without proper treatment can cause serious environmental problems. Coffee husk contains carbohydrates including fermentable sugars, polyphenols such as tannins, lipids. Various microorganisms including filamentous fungi are reported to grow on it despite the presence of antimicrobial compounds. Chemical nature of coffee husk makes it a suitable and inexpensive source for solid-state fermentation. Several studies have been reported on the application of coffee husk in bioprocess. It acts as a substrate as well as carbon source during fermentation. Production of various enzymes such as xylanases, cellulases, polygalacturonases, polyphenol oxidases, tannases in high titers can be achieved by fermentation using coffee husk as substrate. Apart from production of enzymes, bioconversion of coffee husk is also achieved during bioprocess which in turn favors sustainable utilization of waste products. Production of citric acid, gibberellic acid, gallic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and bacterial cellulose is reported by fermentation using coffee husk as substrate. Mass production of microorganisms is another advantage of using coffee husk in bioprocess. It is excellent for the growth of various biocontrol agents such as Trichoderma sp. Besides economic production, prolonged shelf life of biocontrol agents multiplied on coffee husk makes it more attractive. Biopesticides such as Bacillus sphaericus and B. thuringiensis can also be produced by solid-state fermentation on coffee husk. The sustainable management of agro-industrial waste like coffee husk through bioprocess makes it as an attractive source of wealth.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CSS) has various nutritional and functional properties, enabling it for valuable applications. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an efficient and economic extraction technique. In this research, UAE was employed in the extraction of bioactive compounds from CSS with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent. Extraction efficacy between the UAE-treated extracts and the UAE-untreated (control) was assessed in terms of the total phenolic content (TPC), caffeine content, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), and antioxidant capacities. The yields of TPC were in the range from 5.80 ± 0.06 to 8.94 ± 0.01 mg GAE/g sample. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity were highly enhanced by applying UAE compared to the controls. Noticeable caffeine content in the range from 3.27 ± 0.10 to 4.29 ± 0.01 g/100 g sample was found in the CSS samples. CGAs (3-CGA, 4-CGA, and 5-CGA) were all quantified. Methanol–water extracts showed significantly (p {\textless}.05) higher TPC, caffeine content, and antioxidant capacity than water extracts. The micro-structure investigation of CSS indicated UAE can cause cell disruption and micro cracks so that it can be an effective extraction technique. Peleg's model showed a good fitting (R2 {\textgreater} 0.94) to the experimental results on the kinetics of UAE of phenolics compounds. Practical applications: Coffee is a most consumed beverage internationally. Due to its great production, large quantities of residues including coffee pulp and husk, coffee silver skin, and spent coffee grounds are generated in the coffee industry. Among them, coffee silverskin (CSS) is a by-product during the coffee roasting process, which contains nutritional and functional properties. As an efficient and economic novel extraction technique, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed in the current study to extract bioactive compounds from coffee silverskin with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent in order to overcome various disadvantages encountered by the conventional extraction methods. Results indicated that application of UAE pretreatment showed significantly higher recovery of phenolic compounds compared to the controls and high ultrasound intensity (38 W/cm2) was more effective in recovering polyphenols compared to 5 W/cm2 ultrasonic treatments. Therefore, results from the current study provide useful and practical information for the coffee industry.},
