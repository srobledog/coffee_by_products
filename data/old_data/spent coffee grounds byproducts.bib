abstract = {The present research aimed to evaluate the use of spent coffee grounds (SCG) from instant coffee as a food ingredient and its application in bakery products. Data on physicochemical characterization, thermal stability and food safety of SCG were acquired. Evaluation of feasibility as dietary fibre was also determined. Results showed SCG are natural source of antioxidant insoluble fibre, essential amino acids, low glycaemic sugars, resistant to thermal food processing and digestion process, and totally safe. In the present work, SCG were incorporated in biscuit formulations for the first time. Low-calorie sweeteners and oligofructose were also included in the food formulations. Nutritional quality, chemical (acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural and advanced glycation end products) and microbiological safety and sensory tests of the biscuits were carried out. Innovative biscuits were obtained according to consumers' preferences with high nutritional and sensorial quality and potential to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are a significant residue produced annually worldwide. This by-product contains high levels of bioactive compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids that have recognized antioxidant properties. Recovery of these compounds previously for utilization in energy production is an interesting valorization approach, since they can be further incorporated in food products. A rapid, clean and reliable technique is required to discriminate SCG samples with high content of total phenolics, and total flavonoids as well as to assess their antioxidant capacity. In this work, Fourier-transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was used to determine the antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of several SCG samples (n=101). The antioxidant capacity of SCGs was determined by the ABTS assay, using the direct procedure that measures both soluble and insoluble antioxidant fractions and by the indirect approach that assesses the antioxidants present in SCG ethanolic extracts. FT-NIR spectra were calibrated against total flavonoid and total phenolic contents and the antioxidant capacity using PLS modeling. Spectral wavelength selection and latent variables were optimized for the lowest root mean square errors. All PLS models' results showed good linearity with an R2 for an independent test set of 0.93, 0.96, 0.95 and 0.95 for antioxidant capacity of SCGs, antioxidant capacity of SCG ethanolic extracts, and total flavonoid and total phenolic contents, respectively. The range error ratio (RER) was higher than 13 for all models (higher than 16 for three of them). Results confirmed that NIR spectroscopy is a promising technique for routine assessment of these parameters in SCGs and is a viable and advantageous alternative to chemical procedures involving laborious extractions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the last years, some research has demonstrated that this type of biomass can be a good source of bioproducts through its transformation using stand-alone processes or biorefineries. In this sense, this chapter shows a description of coffee grain and an overview of the world production, consumption, and processing stages to obtain the by-products. In order to know the potential and identify the important compounds in the coffee processing, the physicochemical composition of by-products is analyzed. Thus, an analysis of possibilities of integral valorization of by-products as raw materials to obtain antioxidants, biofuels, bioenergy, bioproducts, and biofertilizers is performed. Finally, the biorefinery concept is considered to generate biochemicals and added-value products from the abovementioned residues, taking into account the design of biorefineries, the production scale, and a technical and economic assessment.},

For this purpose, we have reviewed the literature on the composition and safety of coffee flowers, leaves, pulp, husk, parchment, green coffee, silver skin, and spent coffee grounds. Some of these products have a history of consumption in Europe (green coffee), while others have already been used as traditional food in non-EU-member countries (coffee leaves, notification currently pending), or an application for authorization as novel food has already been submitted (husks, flour from spent coffee grounds). For the other products, toxicity and/or safety data appear to be lacking, necessitating further studies to fulfill the requirements of novel food applications.},

The preparation of activated carbon (AC) is detailed. Chemical and physical activation methods are described as well as the characteristics of the AC obtained (textural, structural properties and surface chemistry). The role of the activation process on the adsorption of cations, anions, and organic molecules (pharmaceutical products, pesticides, micropollutants) contained in water is discussed. The use of AC for gas treatment is detailed, especially for acid pollutants (H2S, NO2) and CO2 coming from postcombustion. The last part of this chapter is devoted to the preparation of AC for catalytic application (decomposition of organic molecules). For this specific application, AC has to be functionalized (sulfonation of the surface, or impregnation of K and Fe) in order to obtain catalytic properties. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, thus being a rather relevant food commodity from an economic standpoint. In the coffee processing chain, from plant to cup, a series of by-products are generated in significant amounts with the major ones being husks, parchment husks, chaff (silverskin), and spent coffee ground (SCGs). Currently, these by-products are being underutilized in low-cost applications, e.g., ingredients for animal feed, substrate for composting and vermicomposting, and feedstock for in-farm or coffee industry combustion systems. The knowledge of the physical state and the chemical composition of each specific by-product is essential to define a path for its adequate exploitation. Coffee production and processing by-products present distinct physical and chemical characteristics, however, with a common distribution of classes of compounds among them, with carbohydrates comprising the major fraction, followed by proteins, lipids, ashes, polyphenols and caffeine. Thus, all the by-products are suitable for further profitable exploitation with current proposals for such valorization encompassing recovery of potential food ingredients, recovery and production of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, production of composite materials and films, production of adsorbents and catalysts, and production of biofuels. Thus, a critical overview of the current proposals is herein presented and future directions are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In particular, coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the main coffee industry residues. CS is about 4.2{\%} (w/w) of coffee beans and the valorisation of this waste through the biorefinery approach may boost the circular economy development. In the present contribution, CS was pretreated with one of the mainly investigated biomass pretreatment reported in literature: alkaline hydrolysis in NaOH solutions. After enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated CS, the obtained sugars were used as carbon source to produce butanol and isopropanol by Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423. Moreover, fermentation tests were also carried out with synthetic media to investigate the effects of the alkaline pretreatment on the fermentation process. When pretreated CS was used as feedstock, the largest yields were 0.16 and 0.31 gsolvent/gsugars isopropanol and butanol, respectively. The reported results foster further studies regarding the reuse of CS for solvents production through fermentation processes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and its by-products to produce pelletized fuel, which is expected to help the biodiesel production process achieve zero waste. For this experiment, spent coffee grounds sample was collected from Kaldis coffee, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Extraction of the spent coffee grounds oil was then conducted using n-hexane, ether and mixture of isopropanol to hexane ratio (50:50 {\%}vol), and resulted in oil yield of 15.6, 17.5 and 21.5 {\%}w/w respectively. A two-step process was used in biodiesel production with conversion of about 82 {\%}w/w. The biodiesel quality parameters were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751). The major fatty acid compositions found by Gas chromatography were linoleic acid (37.6{\%}), palmitic acid (39.8{\%}), oleic (11.7{\%}), and stearic acid (8.6{\%}). In addition, solid waste remaining after oil extraction and glycerin ratio (glycerin content from 20-40{\%}) was evaluated for fuel pellet (19.3-21.6 MJ/Kg) applications. Therefore, the results of this work could offer a new perspective to the production of biofuel from waste materials without growing plants and/or converting food to fuel. {\textcopyright} 2014 BRTeam.},

These by-products are a potential source of nutrients and non-nutrient health-promoting compounds, which can be used as a whole ingredient or as an enriched extract of a specific compound. The chemical composition of by-products also determines food safety of the novel ingredients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SCG, included in the concentrate at different concentrations (0, 30, 50 and 100 g/kg), on milk yield and quality, feeding behaviour, dry matter intake, apparent digestibility and ruminal short chain fatty acid profile. In this trial of 51 days of duration, 48 Latxa dairy ewes were used. The ewes were blocked in quartets according to milk yield (1918 ± 287 g) and days in milk (35.7 ± 8.9 days). All of the concentrates were formulated to be isoenergetic (1.01 UFL), isoproteic (166 g/kg), isofat (76 g/kg) and to meet the production needs. The concentrate was given in two doses of 450 g of dry matter during the morning and afternoon milkings, and fescue hay was offered ad libitum. Milk production was recorded and samples were taken for fat, protein and lactose composition analysis. Dry matter intake and apparent dry matter digestibility were estimated using two markers, and feeding behaviour data was recorded. Increasing doses of SCG in the concentrate up to 100 g/kg resulted in a linear (P {\textless} 0.001) increase in the rumen of the isovaleric and isobutyric acid contents which could explain the observed quadratic response (P {\textless} 0.001) in milk yield and a linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in milk protein. A linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in milk fat was found which could be explained by the observed linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in ruminal acetic and butyric acid contents. Increasing doses of SCG in the concentrate linearly decreased ruminal (P {\textless} 0.001) propionic acid content, resulting in a concomitant linear increase (P {\textless} 0.001) in acetic:propionic ratio. Furthermore, no differences were found in intake, apparent dry matter digestibility and feeding behaviour. In conclusion, inclusion of SCG up to 100 g/kg in the concentrate modified ruminal fermentation pattern towards an increase in isoacids and acetic and butyric acid contents in the rumen with a concomitant improvement in milk production and composition without impairing feeding behaviour or apparent digestibility. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are an abundant by-product of the coffee industry with a complex composition that makes them a promising feedstock for a biorefinery. The objective of this study was to evaluate SCG as a substrate for combined chlorogenic acid and bioethanol production after dilute acid hydrolysis. The effect of phenolics extraction on the downstream process was evaluated exhibiting no loss of sugars and an increase in the sugar release efficiency during the dilute acid hydrolysis. In order to suggest an economically feasible process, phenolics extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis prior to ethanol fermentation were optimised by means of experimental design. The responses of the designs were not only the efficiencies of the processes, but also a balance between product recovery and estimated costs. In both cases, decreased efficiencies obtained with low liquid-solid ratios were countervailed by increased products concentrations and higher economical performance. Under the optimised conditions, the purity of the phenolics extract (32{\%}) could allow it to enter the market as a dietary supplement of chlorogenic acid, a product with high trade value. Moreover, a concentration of 3.9{\%} (w/v) ethanol was reached upon fermentation of the hydrolysate of SCG after extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {spent coffee grounds (SCG) are considered valuable by-products because they contain various bioactive compounds. The SCG extraction (SCGE) was irradiated at doses ranging between 30 and 50 kGy. The deep dark-brown color of SCGE was changed to a bright yellow color by gamma irradiation. The content of the bioactive compounds of gamma-irradiated SCGE was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Interestingly, the content of quinic acid was increased by gamma irradiation, whereas other compounds were decreased. Although the contents of bioactive compounds were changed by gamma irradiation, the biological activities (radical scavenging activity and whitening effects) of SCGE were unaffected. Our findings suggest that gamma irradiation can effectively improve the color values of SCGE without the loss of biological activities. Consequently, gamma irradiation can be a useful tool for improving the utilization of SCGE in the cosmetic industry.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The total amount of bio-waste produced annually in the EU by the food and beverage chains is estimated at 37 billion kg. The use of insects for the valorization of by-products from these value chains may represent a sustainable solution. This study aimed to investigate the by-products obtained from different food chains and used for the rearing of black soldier fly (BSF) prepupae, and to evaluate the content and profile of the lipid extracted from the prepupae and outline its possible applications. The substrates used in this experiment were: (i) industrial by-products (brewery spent grains, cows' milk whey, grape stalks, and tomato peels and seeds) and (ii) by-products from retailers (bread dough, fish scraps, and spent coffee ground). Fat extracted from prepupae using an adjusted Folch method was used for total lipid content and fatty acid profile. RESULTS: The best larval performances were obtained from beer (0.22 gweight per prepupa), tomato (0.19 gweight per prepupa), and cheese (0.14 gweight per prepupa) food-chain by-products. The extremely different compositions of the substrates were reflected in the differentiated lipid profile of the BSF prepupae and in the range of ratios between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, which varied from 0.37 for cows' milk whey to 1.34 for tomato peels and seeds. CONCLUSION: The lipids, proteins, and chitin extracted from prepupae are high-value bio-based products that could be used in the feed / food industry or for the development of innovative biomaterials, such as biodiesel. These results suggest that food-chain by-products are the best candidates for insect-bioconversion purposes. {\textcopyright} 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. {\textcopyright} 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract = {The coffee residue left after the preparation of the brew (spent coffee grounds - SCG) is very rich in polysaccharides, namely galactomannans and arabinogalactans, which are polymers that can be used as dietary fibre and present immunostimulatory activity. Considering the huge amount of SCG produced all over the world, the reutilisation of this by-product by its application as food ingredients is very promising. However, the yields of extraction of these polysaccharides tend to be very low, namely the galactomannans. Based on the observation that the yield of galactomannans extracted from the ground coffee to the brew increase when the coffee is roasted, in this study, with the aim of increasing the yield of these polysaccharides, the SCG was roasted and then extracted with hot water and alkali solutions. The roasting at 160 °C promoted an increment of 15{\%} in the yield of galactomannan extractions and further improvement of the yield of extraction until 56{\%} of all galactomannans was achieved by alkali extractions at 60 and 120 °C. In these samples the galactomannans still kept their characteristic structure, including the acetylation and branching, determined by sugar linkage analysis and mass spectrometry. The yield of extraction of arabinogalactans under these conditions was 54{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this work, texture characteristics, proximate composition, total phenolic compounds (TPCs) content, and antioxidant activity were evaluated in cookies added with SCG (0.0, 10.0, 17.5 and 25.0 g/100 g). Intensity of specific sensory characteristics in cookies added with SCG was evaluated by 131 consumers using the just-about-right scale. Texture characteristics were not affected by SCG content. Crude fiber, fat, ash and TPC content increased with the increment of SCG in cookies (p {\textless}.01). All the cookies added with SCG were pleasant for consumers, although cookies with 17.5 g SCG /100 g were preferred (p {\textless}.05). Intensity of coffee flavor and granulosity seemed to determine its acceptance. Adding 17.5 and 25.0 g SCG/100 g in cookies allows to obtain a product acceptable for consumers, considered as dietary fiber source. Practical applications: Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are considered an underutilized by-product by its high content of fiber and presence of antioxidant compounds. During development of functional foods, it is recommendable that the product shows an attractive composition, but also enjoyable sensory characteristics, which make it acceptable for consumers.

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most popular beverages (almost 9 million tons of coffee was consumed in 2014) and the second largest commodity traded worldwide. Coffee beans have long been used for human consumption, in the last centuries, producing coffee brews and instant coffee. About 50{\%} of the coffee produced is directed for the production of soluble coffee generating spent coffee grounds (SCG) as a byproduct that is rich in carbohydrates, protein, lipids and bioactive molecules. SCG has found application as compost (soil conditioner), animal feed (poultry and ruminants), mushroom production, a substrate for fermentation (enzymes) and energy (biogas, liquid biofuel and bioelectricity). SCG composition and structure depends on the coffee beans used in the coffee production, as well as the industrial extraction process. The instant coffee manufacturing uses several hot water extraction steps with different temperature and its severity influences in the soluble solids extraction from the roasted beans and the characteristics of the generated SCG. The industrial process impacts on the amount of SCG generated and soluble compounds extraction, in average 4 kg of wet SCG per kilogram of instant coffee produced. Moreover, the structure of the remained polysaccharides in SCG, cellulose, galactomannan and arabinogalactan, can be more recalcitrant to further use. The SCG still contain extractable compounds (flavor and oil) in a lignocellulosic matrix formed by cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. These structural compounds are organized in the cell wall as a recalcitrant structure to the biological conversion process. Moreover, SCG is resistant to degradation and may need a pretreatment to make the material suitable for biotechnological conversion. The pretreatment disrupts the cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin structure, changing its properties and allowing a complex of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes breaking down polysaccharides into fermentable sugars. The factors responsible for SCG recalcitrance is related to its chemical composition, structural and physicochemical properties that influence the pretreatment response end requires a complex pool of enzymes to its hydrolysis. This review will focus on discuss the recalcitrance properties of the SCG, based on its composition and structural organization, and the complex enzyme necessary for its conversion, highlighting its impact on biotechnology and bioenergy process. {\textcopyright} 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are abundant, low-cost and versatile feedstocks for a wide range of high-valued end products. With a goal to achieve zero waste, this study aims to further broaden the diversity by using the residue for bioactive components, biodiesel production, as well as for the manufactures of activated carbon and fuel pellet. The analyzed SCG oil was rich in palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for more than 50 {\%} of the oil composition. Among different extraction methods, microwave-Assisted extraction (MAE) was found to be recommended for maximal yields of SCG's oil (17.00 {\%}) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (31.15 mg quercetin/g); while ultrasound-Assisted extraction (UAE) was more efficient toward the recovery of lipid hydroperoxide (LP) (0.0191 mM) and total phenolic content (TPC) (13.500 mg AG/g). Optimal SCG-over-solvent ratio was another studied parameter. The research also confirmed the antioxidant capability of the coffee grounds. The production of SCG's biodiesel followed the conventional esterification and transesterification processes. The assessment of the fuel complied with the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM 6751); and most of the analyzed values satisfied the standards. The activated carbon (AC) generated from SCG demonstrated a comparable purification capacity. The BET surface area and total pore volume were 1,547 m2/g and 0.225 cm3/g. For optimal area's value, a chemical activation by KOH, at 800 °C and 1:1-impregnation ratio was advisable. The solid waste after the oil extraction was used to produce fuel pellet with a high measured heating value (22 MJ/kg). The study underlined spent coffee grounds as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. The residue offered not only a cut in raw material's cost, but also an increase in net profit through the commercialization of other value-Added by-products.

Within the biorefinery paradigm, where renewable resources are converted into a range of high, medium and low value products, in an analogous manner to fossil fuels in a petrochemical refinery, SCG have been established as an amenable lignocellulosic feedstock through numerous research efforts. In this critical review, we give an extensive overview for the first time of the primary and secondary product suites that can be generated from SCG, along with their potential applications. The handful of preliminary technoeconomic and lifecycle assessment of using SCG for bioenergy is discussed, highlighting the economic limitations of a single capability, phase one biorefinery operating under the current scale and logistics of SCG collection.

abstract = {In this study, we assess the potential of supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS) for valorization of spent coffee grounds (SCG). SUPRAS, made up of self-assembled amphiphilic aggregates dispersed in an aqueous or hydro-organic medium, are excellent extractants that provide multiple binding interactions (hydrogen bonds, dispersion, dipole-dipole, etc.) and microenvironments of different polarity due to their special internal architecture. In this work, SUPRAS made up of different amphiphiles (decanoic acid and hexanol) and hydro-organic media (water-ethanol and water-tetrahydrofuran) were investigated for extraction of bioactives from SCG. Extraction was optimized from the yield obtained for caffeine and 5-chlorogenic acid, that were considered as model compounds. Under optimal extraction conditions, the profile of bioactive compounds in the extracts was screened by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and the total phenolic content was estimated. The antioxidants and antimicrobial properties of the extracts were also evaluated. Bioactive compounds were extracted from wet SCG up to 3.32 mg g(-1) and 4.3 mg g(-1) SCG of caffeine and chlorogenic acid, respectively. Extracts showed antioxidant capacity by different assays (DPPH, TEAC, FRAP) in accordance with their high total phenolic content (60.1 mg CGA per mg of extracted dry SCG). SUPRAS offered advantages in terms of rapidity (extraction for 1 min) and simplicity (the process involved stirring and centrifugation at room temperature), thus avoiding costly processes based on high pressure and temperature. Furthermore, SUPRAS extracts exhibited certain degree of antimicrobial effects against, S. aureus and B. cereus and a high effect against S. enterica and P. putida.},

abstract = {Here in this study, co-pyrolysis of paper mill sludge (PMS) and spent coffee ground (SCG) was conducted to mainly recover energy and additionally produce engineered biochar as an adsorbent. More specifically, to enhance the generation of syngas (H-2 and CO) through co-pyrolysis of PMS and SCG and modify the physicochemical properties of biochar, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as reaction medium. The CO2 co-feeding impact on co-pyrolysis with various mass ratios of PMS and SCG was also evaluated to explore any catalytic effects arising from CO2 and Fe/Ca species in PMS. The decrease in pyrolytic oil substances was apparent due to the synergistic effects of CO2 and Fe/Ca species. Moreover, the generation of CO was catalytically enhanced in the presence of Fe/Ca species in PMS. Co-pyrolysis in CO2 not only converted the impregnated Fe ions into magnetite (Fe3O4), but also created porous biochar. One biochar fabricated at the optimal mass ratio (PMS: SCG = 7:3) exhibited the highest adsorption capability toward As(V) due to adequate balancing between the amount of Fe/Ca solid minerals and biochar porosity. As a result, co-pyrolysis using CO2 as reaction medium can be a feasible option for the generation of CO along with production of biochar as a byproduct which can be used in environmental application.},

Cultivation with TPEW and SCG did not result in any significant differences in the contents of K, Mg, P, and S in fruiting bodies. The highest content of Ca and Na was recorded in cultivation with TPEW. The use of TPEW and SCG increased the total phenolic content, while in the phenolic profile changes were observed in the variants of 50{\%} and 100{\%} TPEW and 50{\%} SCG. Cultivation with TPEW increased the sum of the organic acids and quinic, malonic, malic, acetic, and succinic acids, while addition of SCG resulted in their significant decrease. Practical applications The use of different additives to growing substrate is a possible way to improve the harvest yield. Moreover, this modification of cultivation allows to manage some waste materials. However, the application of waste materials can carry the risk to introduce substances potentially dangerous for human health into substrate. Additionally, the supplementation allows to modify the content of bioactive compounds. In this context, the monitoring of the quality of fruiting bodies seems to be necessary. Therefore, the study evaluated the content of elements (especially toxic trace elements), some bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity was examined. The results pointed, how the waste materials added to the substrate affect the quality of the final product. These findings could lead to improvements in the commercial production ofP. eryngiiand increase the quality of the final product.},

abstract = {Recovery of phenolic content from waste is one of the main concerns for any possible applications. This study was done to investigate and explore the functional properties of cocoa waste (CW) from espresso cocoa production. The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay (DPPH), metal (Fe2+) chelating activity was determined. Parameters include water holding capacity (WHC), oil holding capacity (OHC), swelling capacity (SWC), proximate compositions, total dietary fiber (TDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and soluble dietary fiber (SDF) were also determined. As a reference spent coffee ground (SCG) was also studied under all parameters. Two solvents, ethanol and water were used to extract the bioactive compounds from CW. The ethanol-CW extract was found to contain significantly the highest (p {\textless} 0.05) TPC and TFC with 52.3 mg GAE/ml sample and 84.36 mg Quercetin/ml sample respectively. This was correlated to its high (p {\textless} 0.05) antioxidant activities in DPPH (IC50 3.58 +/- 0.07 mg/ml) and metal chelating activity (IC50 2.32 +/- 0.09 A mu g/ml). Positive correlations ranging from r(2) = 0.82 to 0.98 were established between the phytochemicals and antioxidant activities of all extracts. All samples displayed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) high WHC and SWC, in relevance to their high (p {\textless} 0.05) TDF which were over 60{\%} of 100 g dry matter. CW exhibited significantly high (p {\textless} 0.05) IDF/SDF ratio, in contrast to SCG with also high protein content of 13{\%}. This study indicates that CW has a potential as a source of natural antioxidant and phytochemical in functional food development and intermediate food ingredient.},

Largely consumed foods are rich sources of phenol polymers, notably black foods traditionally used in East Asia, but other non-edible, easily accessible sources, e.g., seaweeds and wood, have been considered with increasing interest together with waste materials from agro-based industries, primarily grape pomace and other byproducts of fruit and coffee processing. Not in all cases were the main structural components of these materials identified because of their highly heterogeneous nature. The great beneficial effects of natural phenol-based polymers on human health and their potential in improving the quality of food were largely explored, and this review critically addresses the most interesting and innovative reports in the field of nutrition and biomedicine that have appeared in the last five years. Several in vivo human and animal trials supported the proposed use of these materials as food supplements and for amelioration of the health and production of livestock. Biocompatible and stable functional polymers prepared by peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols, as well as natural phenol polymers were exploited as conventional and green plastic additives in smart packaging and food-spoilage prevention applications. The potential of natural phenol polymers in regenerative biomedicine as additives of biomaterials to promote growth and differentiation of osteoblasts is also discussed.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) generated after coffee extraction are the main byproduct of the coffee industry. Valorization of the SCG has been increasingly focused following considerable attention in coffee consumption. Lactic acid bacteria fermentation is the primary source of generation of lactic acid, a monomer of polylactic acid that has various industrial applications; however, because of the low tolerance of lactic acid bacteria to toxic compounds, it is necessary to apply Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce lactic acid whose tolerance to toxic compounds is higher. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using SCG as substrate for the production of lactic acid by S. cerevisiae strain expressing heterologous lactate dehydrogenase. The fermentation profiles of the engineered yeast showed that lactic acid production was promoted by xylose addition. From simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using a whole slurry of acid-pretreated SCG, containing high amounts of hemicellulose fractions, lactic acid (0.11 g) and ethanol (0.10 g) per g SCG were obtained after 24 h of SSF, of which yields were 413{\%} and 221{\%} higher, respectively, than those of washed pretreated SCG. Thus, fermentation of whole slurry SCG by engineered S. cerevisiae is a suitable way of lactic acid production, selectively.},

Indeed, this by-product of food industry is available worldwide in huge amount, already in powder form, reducing the pretreatments required before extraction process. By microwave-assisted extraction is possible to enhance antioxidant extraction yields even when eco-friendly solvents are used. The purposes of this study were the optimization of the antioxidant extraction process, the analysis of its kinetics, and the production of a biocompatible extract to be potentially used in cosmetics. In this work, a first optimization was carried out on the solvent composition, temperature and extraction time by response surface methodology. The extract with the highest bioactive molecule content (32 mg/L of caffeine; 9 mg/L of chlorogenic acid), obtained at 150 degrees C, 90 min of extraction time and using ethanol/water 54:46 (v/v) as solvent, was tested on human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 in order to assess its biocompatibility. In addition, utilizing the optimal conditions for solvent composition and temperature, the kinetic of extraction was studied and Peleg's model well described experimental results, allowing to observe that an extraction time of 60 min was actually sufficient to reach the maximum polyphenol yield (46 +/- 2.9 Mg-caffeic acid equivalent/g(dried solid)).

The development of an economically attractive and environmentally sustainable process based on available experimental data on the SCGs valorization has not been investigated in the open literature. This is clearly a very important issue and is the subject of the present work. Evidence is presented to support the conclusion that the economic performance of the process can be acceptable only at large production capacities realized at centralized facilities. In addition, it is shown, using a ``gate-to-gate{\{}''{\}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCI), that the environmental performance of the process is acceptable and the process can be considered sustainable. Further research is necessary in the area of efficient recovery of the bioactive compounds available in SCGs.

Four PS were extracted and analyzed from 14 SCG samples from 12 countries. Sonication in acidic conditions followed by saponification resulted determinant for PS extraction. PS were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) after derivatization. In the order of abundance, the PS were beta-sitosterol (188.5-688.5 mg kg(-1)), campesterol (48.6-214.5 mg kg(-1)), stigmasterol (58.9-188.5 mg kg(-1)), and cycloartenol (14.6-65.8 mg kg(-1) mg kg(-1)). Total PS fraction ranged from 343.4 mg kg(-1) to 1146.3 mg kg(-1) of SCG with an average level of 618.2 +/- 195.4 mg kg(-1). Considering the millions of tons of SCG produced every year, this by-product could be a sustainable source of PS to fill a growing global demand.},

abstract = {The circular bioeconomy plan is an innovative research based scheme intended for augmenting the complete utilization and management of bio-based resources in a sustainable biorefinery route. Spent coffee grounds based biorefinery is the emerging aspect promoting circular bioeconomy. The sustainable circular bioeconomy by utilizing SCG is achieved by cascade approaches and the inclusion of many biorefinery approaches to obtain many bio-products. The maximum energy recovery can be obtained by process integration. The economic analysis of the biofuel production from SCG is dependent on the cost of raw material, transportation, the need of labor and energy, oil extraction operations and biofuel production. The inclusion of new products from already established product can minimize the investment cost when related to the production cost. A positive net present value can be achieved via SCG biorefinery which indicates the profitability of the process.},

abstract = {The spent coffee ground is a by-product of the coffee industry with high potential because of its beneficial properties for health, however, due to high water content, it is necessary to stabilize it without affecting bioactive capacities. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different convective drying conditions, on some technological and functional properties of the spent coffee ground and to determine the thermal degradation kinetics of chlorogenic acids. The methodology included the optimization of the drying process conditions of spent coffee ground: temperature (40-60 degrees C), air flow (1.0-2.0 m/s) and cake thickness (0.01-0.02 m). Effective diffusion coefficient, moisture, water activity, water and oil holding capacity, antioxidant capacity, caffeine, and seven chlorogenic acids were determined. The results showed that the best drying conditions were 60 degrees C, 2.0 m/s, 1.28 cm which allows retaining 84.24{\%} of total polyphenols and 66.00{\%} of the antioxidant capacity. Chlorogenic acids showed thermal degradation kinetics of first order under the optimal process conditions. In general, it is concluded that the convective drying process is a valid technique for processing of coffee grounds, as it allows the preservation of antioxidant compounds with a potentially beneficial effect on health, providing a stabilized low moisture content that can be used in food applications.

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing awareness of the need to reduce waste and protect the environment. During the preparation of a coffee beverage, large amounts of a solid residue known as spent coffee grounds (SCG) are produced. This study investigates the recovery of phytochemicals from SCG. The aim is to estimate the effect of a wide number variables on the amount of caffeine and phytochemicals recovered with a green method for water-soluble compounds that does not require the use of organic solvents. In the first part, we use a Plackett-Burman design to estimate which extraction parameters have most influence on phytochemical recovery. In the second part, we test only the significant factors and caffeine and chlorogenic acids were quantified using HPLC-DAD. The first part of the study showed that the temperature and the type of SCG can significantlyaffect the phytochemical recovery. In the second part, four temperatures and two types of SCG were tested and thehigher concentrations of caffeine and chlorogenic acids were found at 110 degrees C. Furthermore, a significant effect was found for type of SCG with significantly higher phytochemical recovery for the French Press compared to the Espresso method. The mild temperature, combined with the use of water as a solvent make the recovery system both green and low-cost. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In coffee-producing countries, waste products from coffee production are useful substrates for cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus. This species is relatively easy to grow, coffee waste substrates are readily available and the mushroom fruiting bodies are a valuable source of nutrition and income. In developed countries, cultivation of P. ostreatus on spent coffee grounds (SCG) from coffee consumption is a novel way to recycle this urban waste product. Here, we studied the effect of SCG and caffeine on growth of a commercial strain of P. ostreatus in liquid and solid cultures, and on a commercial scale. The presence of caffeine inhibited mycelial growth on agar and in liquid culture in the laboratory. Increased levels of SCG in an SCG/sawdust substrate also delayed mycelial growth and delayed or prevented fruiting during commercial cultivation. Despite growth inhibition, partial degradation of caffeine to xanthine by P. ostreatus mycelium was observed in all SCG-containing substrate mixtures. Degradation of caffeine proceeded mainly via sequential N-demethylation to theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) and 3-methylxanthine, although both paraxanthine and theobromine also accumulated in the substrate. Caffeine and its demethylated metabolites were also detected in fruiting bodies, but it was not clear whether caffeine metabolism occurred in the fruiting bodies themselves or whether caffeine metabolites were translocated there from the mycelium. Based on the caffeine concentrations measured in fruiting bodies after growth with SCG, it would be necessary to consume 250kg of fresh oyster mushrooms to obtain the amount of caffeine equivalent to one cup of espresso coffee, suggesting that the health impact of caffeine in these mushrooms is low. However, the ability of P. ostreatus to degrade caffeine indicates that this and other species in this genus may have potential applications in detoxification of coffee production wastes.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG) and coffee silverskins (CSS) are two high-volume industrial by-products rich in valuable components, such as alkaloids, diterpenic, and phenolic compounds, triglycerides (oils), and polysaccharides. Their recovery yield and purity are highly dependent on the selected extraction method and operating conditions. This chapter discusses recent advances on the following separation technologies: solid-liquid extraction (SLE) using conventional solvents and ionic liquids, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), subcritical water extraction, ultrasound assisted extraction, and microwave assisted extraction. SLE and SFE are the most mature approaches for the extraction of coffee by-products, although promising results have been reported for the other technologies. Solvents like ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents are expected to play an important role in the near future, along with other approaches, such as pervaporation, nanofiltration, sorption (adsorption and ion exchange), hydrothermal liquefaction, pulsed electric fields extraction, and products synthesis under the scope of nanotechnology. Overall, these methods produce oils/extracts rich in phenolic compounds exhibiting valuable antioxidant activity levels, with encouraging extraction yields. The optimization of both operating conditions and unit's arrangement is crucial to ensure their technological and economic viability. Currently, a considerable number of scientific studies and patents demonstrate or claim their use for various applications, including dermatological formulations, pest control formulations, growth enhancer substrates for bacterial cultures, biodiesel production, among others.},

abstract = {Spent Coffee Grounds worldwide production is estimated at around 6 M tons only at industrial level. The abundance and the heterogeneity of this substrate make it an ideal substrate for a biorefinery approach based on the ``cascade biorefinery hierarchy{\{}''{\}}. Currently, the major part of spent coffee grounds is sent to incineration and landfill disposal, options which should be avoided. Instead, they could be valorised through biofuels production. All the operational parameters leading to the highest biogas (350-400L(CH4)/kg(TVS)), bioethanol (3-4{\%}v/v) and biodiesel (over 90{\%} of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters concentration) yields from spent coffee grounds have been discussed in this review paper. They are rich in an oil phase containing different added-value molecules (tocopherols, cafestol, kahweol along with linoleic and palmitic acids), which can be extracted and used as additives for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Solid/liquid extraction techniques of coffee oil from spent coffee grounds such as the most common Soxhlet technique and the more innovative fluids in supercritical conditions have been discussed, with coffee oil recovery of around 5-15{\%}w/w and 15-20{\%}w/w, respectively. The most recent applications of the extracted coffee oil have been also presented: the added-value molecules recovery and purification after micro/ultra and nano filtrations processes and the polyhydroxyalkanoates (0.84 g/g) and biosurfactants (3.5 g/L) production. Considering the whole information, an integrated biorefinery scheme, along with the respective mass balances were proposed. The novelty of this paper lies in the integration of the state-of-the-art data, in a biorefinery concept that would allow the production of both biofuels and value-added products.},

This chapter explores the possibilities of utilizing SCG as a precursor for the production of biochar via pyrolysis. In addition, its potential agricultural and fabric applications are also reviewed taking into account that it is a carbon-rich and nutrient-enriched material. Initially, the thermochemical conversion of biomass into various energy forms and the biochar characterization are described. The exhausted coffee residue and its potential utilization for the production of various energy forms were then addressed. The pyrolysis process for the sustainable management of exhausted coffee residue is further reviewed.

Extraction from SCG and STL were achieved by three conventional techniques (infusion, boiling and incubation at room temperature). Thereafter, different concentrations from each by-product were examined. The results showed that, under salt stress, STL extract at 1.5{\%} dry tea leaves (DTL), obtained by infusion extraction, displayed the best response in terms of final germination percentage (FGP), time taken for cumulative germination to reach 50{\%} of its maximum (t50) and germination uniformity (U-7525), whereas, the best improve in root length was obtained with 2.25{\%} DTL compared with unprimed culture. Against drought stress, SCG extract at 4{\%} dry coffee ground (DCG), obtained following incubation extraction, resulted in amelioration in FGP and U-7525, however, 2{\%} DCG engendered the best stimulation of growth. Added directly to the medium culture, STL (1.5{\%} DTL) caused a highly significant inhibition of the germination process with both types of stress. However, SCG (2{\%} DCG) supplementation is recommended mainly in drought stress to improve seedlings growth. Organic priming and medium supplementation can be alternative pathways for SCG and STL wastes valorization. Furthermore, these techniques can be a good cropping practice to improve seed potentiality against environmental challenges in sustainable agriculture. {\{}[{\}}GRAPHICS] .},

Spent coffee grounds (SCG), the main by-product of coffee brewing, represent a serious environmental problem, but could become an important source of bioactive compounds for the pharmaceutical and food-processing industry. The aim of this work was, therefore, to study the effect of organic farming on bioactive and antioxidant properties of SCG; comparing samples of organic and conventionally grown coffee from the Mexican states of Veracruz and Chiapas, both of which produce coffee with the `Protected Designation of Origin' distinction. Concentrations of total phenolic compound and total flavonoid compounds, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2 `-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline 6- sulphonic-acid) antioxidant activity, and brown compound concentration were determined in SCG. Repeated measures ANOVAs were carried out on the data. Organic SCG samples showed significantly higher bioactive compound concentration (p {\textless} 0.01) and antioxidant activity (p {\textless} 0.001) than conventional SCG samples. This difference held across various extractions and the two geographical locations. Thus, this Mexican organic coffee by-product may represent an interesting source of such compounds for diverse industrial applications. Given that Mexico is one of the top producers of organic coffee in the world, there is a need for further research to consider other important variables, such as the type of coffee processing by-product and the type of coffee extraction process.},

abstract = {Largely produced agri-food byproducts represent a sustainable and easily available source of phenolic compounds, such as lignins and tannins, endowed with potent antioxidant properties. We report herein the characterization of the antioxidant properties of nine plant-derived byproducts. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assays indicated the superior activity of pomegranate peels and seeds, grape pomace and pecan nut shell. An increase in the antioxidant potency was observed for most of the waste materials following a hydrolytic treatment, with the exception of the condensed tannin-rich pecan nut shell and grape pomace. UV-Vis and HPLC investigation of the soluble fractions coupled with the results from IR analysis and chemical degradation approaches on the whole materials allowed to conclude that the improvement of the antioxidant properties was due not only to removal of non-active components (mainly carbohydrates), but also to structural modifications of the phenolic compounds. Parallel experiments run on natural and bioinspired model phenolic polymers suggested that these structural modifications positively impacted on the antioxidant properties of lignins and hydrolyzable tannins, whereas significant degradation of condensed tannin moieties occurred, likely responsible for the lowering of the reducing power observed for grape pomace and pecan nut shell. These results open new perspectives toward the exploitation and manipulation of agri-food byproducts for application as antioxidant additives in functional materials.},

abstract = {As never before, there is nowadays the will to consider alternative energy sources from renewable and waste materials so as to preserve planet and society. One of the possible elements suitable for this purpose is every day in our houses: Coffee. Or rather, spent coffee grounds. Indeed, many studies in recent years have addressed its potential exploitation, especially for biodiesel production; recent works also pointed out its possible thermal valorization for industrial processes. In light of this, this paper proposes a new sustainable use of spent coffee grounds, converted into combustible pellets; this source can then be used not only for industrial heaters, but also for public or private buildings. To this end, a feasibility study of a pellet production plant fed by waste collected by vending companies operating in the North of Italy is developed, including the logistic model supported by an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system to help gather spent coffee grounds from the different companies and collect them into the pellet production facility.},

abstract = {The production of phosphoric acid from phosphate rock leads to an industrial by-product called phosphogypsum (PG). One ton of phosphoric acid generates 5 tons of PG that is frequently stocked near the production units. Several attempts were made to test PG valorization via soil amendment because of its phosphate, sulphate and calcium content. In this study, the use of PG in composting was envisaged. Composts were produced by mixing olive oil wastes and spent coffee grounds. Two concentrations of PG, 10{\%} (A(10)) and 30{\%} (A(30)), were tested in composting substrate in addition to control compost without PG (A(T)). After 8 months of fermentation, the resulting composts were used in field experiments using nine different treatments conducted to evaluate the potential use of these PG-containing composts in potato plant (cv. Spunta) cultivation. Plants were grown in the field and the different composts (A(T), A(10) and A(30)) were added as fertilizer and compared to commercial compost and cattle manure. During the culture period, a number of physiological (dry weight, chlorophyll content, tuber yield) and biochemical parameters (antioxidant activities, mineral content, starch and protein content) were followed. Similarly, chlorophyll content was measured in plants cultivated on commercial or PG supplemented composts. An increment of 55.17{\%} in potato yield was recorded with the use of A(30) the compost. Collectively, these data reveal the positive impact of the addition of PG in composting which may be adopted as a strategy for PG valorization and its use for the production of high quality edible products.

abstract = {This paper investigates the strength and microstructure properties of spent coffee grounds stabilized with rice husk ash and slag geopolymers to produce a green construction subgrade material. Spent coffee grounds (CG) and rice husk ash (RHA) are organic wastes derived from agricultural products. CG is the residue from ground coffee beans. RHA is a by-product from the burning rice husk used to generate electricity. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (S) is a waste by-product derived from steel production. RHA and S were used as geopolymeric precursors (P). This study provides an insight on the long-term strength performance and microstructural formation of geopolymers synthesized from agricultural waste products. The influence factors studied were liquid alkaline activator content (L), RHA content, S content, temperature and curing time. By observing the strength development of CG-RHA geopolymers for up to 90 days, it was found that elevated temperature curing was needed for these CG:RHA geopolymers to develop long-term strengths. Test results show that an optimum mix of CG:RHA:S 70:20:10 cured at 50 degrees C can achieve an Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of 2 MPa after 90 days of curing. The outcome of this research will enable CG, S and RHA waste products to be used as sustainable materials in pavement applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative application for spent coffee grounds (SCGs) used as filler for the formulation of lightweight clay ceramic aggregates (LWA). LWA can be used for urban and agricultural purposes as a sustainable solution. Spent coffee grounds were tested as a pore forming agent partially acting as a replacement for red clay in material formulation before firing. Substitutions of 10, 15, and 20 wt.{\%} of red clay were tested. The properties of lightweight aggregates with 15 wt.{\%} of SCGs were improved using a specifically tailored fertilizer glass due to its low pH and conductivity within the soil tolerance range. Packaging glassy sand, cattle-bone flour ash, and potassium carbonate were mixed and melted in order to obtain this glass, which when added to the clayey batch functionalized the aggregates by phosphorus and potassium nutrients. The results (in particular, porosity and bulk density) show that the lightweight aggregates obtained have interesting properties for possible uses both in urban (e.g., green roofs as a drainage layer) and agricultural purposes. Moreover, pH and conductivity are in line with the Italian Standard regarding soil amendment (D.lgs. 75/2010). In addition, several leaching tests were performed in a solution containing 2 vol.{\%} citric acid (C6H8O7) to evaluate the release capacity not only of nutrients (P and K) but also to check the presence and release of heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), that may come from the glassy precursor. The results obtained showed that nutrients are efficiently released in 21 days (P = 87.73{\%} and K = 25.74{\%} of released percentage) and Pb release is under the standard threshold of 30 ppm.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds (SCG), a processing by-product from the coffee industry, were evaluated as a potential feedstock for preparing agropellets for energy production. Hence, pure SCG and a SCG/sawdust blend were transformed into pellets. The latter thermal and chemical properties such as calorific value, ash content, bulk density, fixed carbon and elemental analysis were obtained. Thermogravimetric analyses were conducted in order to determine pyrolysis kinetics and combustion characteristics in order to study the agropellets performance. The obtained results show that SCG pellets thermal characteristics are in the same order as conventional biomasses such as sawdust. Moreover, blend 50{\%} SCG/50{\%} sawdust reaches the superior NF agropellets standard requirements which are essential to sell this agropellets in the French market. Analysis of the thermal degradation shows that SCG and its blend follow the usual behavior of lignocellulosic materials. Comparison of the combustion characteristics shows a higher reactivity of the blend comparing to pure SCG and sawdust. Such behavior might relate to heterogeneous structure and mutual interaction of the individual components of SCG and sawdust. Pyrolysis kinetics parameters obtained for SCG and SCG/sawdust blend are fairly close agreement with those found in literature for different biomasses. Hence SCG/sawdust may be a promising biofuel for the energy production in industrial applications. (c) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In food and drink manufacturing, costs must be relentlessly minimised because margins for most products are low. At the same time, the business case for biorefining of lignocellulosic feedstocks has been positive in only a small number of cases. Since the two industries use similar feedstocks and processing equipment, there should be potential for significant sharing of resources for economic and environmental gain, particularly with regard to energy, if they were co-located. This paper reviews the nature, issues and opportunities for this sort of resource sharing between food industries and biorefineries. It then illustrates the opportunity by modelling a food product (coffee bean roasting) co-located with lignocellulosic biorefining of its downstream by-product (spent coffee grounds) where biofuels are not the target output, identifying and evaluating the resource efficiencies and economics involved. The analysis shows that there can be significant benefits, but that the exact nature of the food and biorefinery products and the biorefining pathways are the key dependencies. Further research should produce a comprehensive league table of co-location opportunities for the benefit of both industries to enhance both their economics and their sustainability metrics through well-targeted synergies.

OOD and FAB were exploited for the first time as alternative substrates for PHA production. UCO, OOD and FAB were used by Cupriavidus necator and Pseudomonas oleovorans to synthesize the homopolymer poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, while Pseudomonas resinovorans and Pseudomonas citronellolis produced mcl-PHA polymers mainly composed of hydroxyoctanoate and hydroxydecanoate monomers. The highest polymer content in the biomass was obtained for C. necator (62 wt.{\%}) cultivated on OOD. Relatively high mcl-PHA content (28-31 wt.{\%}) was reached by P. resinovorans cultivated in OOD. This study shows, for the first time, that OOD is a promising substrate for PHA production since it gives high polymer yields and allows for the synthesis of different polymers (scl- or mcl-PHA) by selection of the adequate strains.},

abstract = {Use of organic amendments is a good strategy for combating the growing problem of soil degradation due to deterioration of organic matter content, particularly severe in semi-arid European Mediterranean regions, while at the same time providing an opportunity for recycling organic wastes. Olive mill pomace (OMP), the main by-product of the olive oil industry, is being used increasingly in olive grove soils for this purpose. Although the positive effects of OMP amendments have been widely studied, they also have some negative effects on soil. One of the most critical is that they increase water repellency (WR) due to the presence of poorly evolved, strongly aliphatic compounds. This detrimental effect has received very little attention, although it may impair plant water availability and infiltration rates, increase erosion and lower long-term soil quality. This study proposed, for the first time, thermal treatment as an effective way of reducing WR in organic amendments (i.e. mixtures of OMP, olive tree pruning, chicken manure and spent coffee grounds) prior to their application to soil. Thermal treatment at 275 degrees C proved effective in removing WR, while lower temperatures (175 or 225 degrees C) can even increase it. Changes by thermal treatment in the characteristics of the organic amendments studied with FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed that it strongly reduced the aliphatic compounds mainly responsible for their hydrophobicity, concentrated aromatic compounds and increased thermostability. Heating also reduced phytotoxicity, making all of the organic amendments usable in the field (germination index over 100{\%}). Therefore, heating at 275 degrees C could be an acceptable option for removing WR from organic amendments, enhancing their quality with more stable evolved characteristics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Because of the important role of bioactive compounds in functional foods and health care, more and more attention has been paid to the active components extracted by green extraction methods. However, how to ensure the extraction yield and biological activity during the extraction process is an urgent problem to be solved. Subcritical water extraction (SWE) is a promising engineering method, which provides an environmentally friendly technology for extracting various bioactive compounds from natural products. Especially, under high temperature and high pressure, subcritical water can change the polarity and dielectric constant of solvents, thus contributing to a better extraction process, improving the mass transfer efficiency of the extracts and maintaining its biological activities, which has a high application prospect. Scope and approach: This review provided an update overview on the fundamental principles and bioactive compounds extraction with subcritical water. This will contribute to deepen the understanding of SWE and provide theoretical basis and reference value for further improving the application of subcritical water. Key founds and conclusions: It is expected that this green and efficient extraction technology will be increasingly applied in the extraction of more bioactive ingredients in the near future. In addition, future research should consider combining SWE with other physical extraction techniques to ensure the retention of the biological ingredients better. These active compounds with SWE have great potential in health care medicine and functional foods. Meanwhile, future researches should focus on consumer acceptability, safety, legal aspects, and commercial availability of health products.},

This review provides an overview of selected mass-produced botanical food byproducts and coproducts (BFBC) including soybean okara, wheat germ, banana, and spent coffee grounds, with respect to value-added sustainable processing via proper drying technologies being employed. This review includes the current production of the above-mentioned agricultural products, the nutritional aspects of them, and the sustainable utilization of their coproducts. Additionally, the possible drying kinetics for value-added prospects are discussed.},

abstract = {Spent coffee grounds collected from coffee bars (SCG-1) or recovered from coffee capsules (SCG-2) were investigated as a potential source of phenolic compounds and energy. Preliminary characterization of these materials provided a total phenolic content of 17.75 mg GAE/g for SCG-1 and 21.56 mg GAE/g for SCG-2. A solvent-extraction procedure using aqueous ethanol as the solvent and operating under mild temperature conditions was developed and tested. A two-level factorial design was used to study the effects of temperature (T = 30-50 degrees C), extraction time (E = 60-120 min), liquid-to-solid ratio (R = 20-40 mL/g) and ethanol concentration in the aqueous mixture (C = 30-70 vol{\%}) on the recovery of phenolic compounds. Under the best conditions, over 90{\%} of the phenolic compounds contained in the starting waste materials were recovered. T, R and C were the most influential factors and all of them had a positive effect on the extraction efficiency. The calorific values of the two coffee wastes were 23.72 MJ/kg (SCG-1) and 24.07 MJ/kg (SCG-2). They were only marginally affected by the extraction procedure, which supports the possibility of integrating the recovery of phenolic compounds with the use of the resulting solid residue to produce pellets or other agglomerates for heating purposes. A case study application aimed at evaluating the potential valorization of the spent coffee produced in the Province of Rome is also presented. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A solid-liquid extraction method using ethanol-water mixtures was combined with cLC-DAD, LC-MS/MS and chemometric analyses for establishing the optimum extraction conditions of valuable polyphenols from spent coffee grounds. Chlorogenic and p-coumaric acids were the most abundant polyphenols found, ranging from 0.02 to 4.8 mg g(-1) and 0.173-0.50 mg g(-1), respectively. In addition, total polyphenol content (9-29 mg GAE g(-1) DW), total flavonoid content (11-27 mg QE g(-1) DW), total antioxidant activity (0.3 7 mg GAE g(-1) DW) and free radical scavenging ability (DPPH assay, 64-927 mu g extract g(-1) at EC50) of obtained extracts were determined. Response surface methodology allowed obtaining predictive models for the extraction of each individual polyphenol. On the other hand, multifactorial ANOVA was used to establish differences between coffee and spent coffee ground extracts. Principal component analysis was also employed to relate antioxidant activities, total polyphenol and total flavonoid contents with both the polyphenols extracted and the residue coffee type. The overall results suggested that spent coffee grounds could be reused as a promising, inexpensive and natural source of bioactive polyphenols with potential industrial applications, thus minimizing the waste disposal and environmental impact.

abstract = {Agrifood by-products are perfect candidates to be further processed under the concept of circular economy, in order to produce their valorization. Although significant amounts of food-related wastes that are discarded are produced worldwide, these might still be rich in valuable compounds. A strategy to further valorize agrifood-related by-products is based on pyrolysis processes. The result of this process is a liquid product termed bio-oil which is composed of an organic phase and an aqueous phase. This bio-oil is rich on a variety of components and its analysis implies several challenges. In this work, quantitative on-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) is proposed for the first time to characterize several aqueous phases of different bio-oils. Rice husk, peanut shell, spent coffee grounds, peach core and Eucalyptus sawdust biomasses were analyzed. The developed quantitative LC x LC method presented very good linearity, precision, reproducibility, recovery and LODs and LOQs as low as 0.05 mu g mL(-1) and 0.16 mu g mL(-1), respectively. As much as 28 components were simultaneously separated and quantified in those samples. Our results found that the composition of these bio-oils was different but strongly related to the agrifood by-product submitted to pyrolysis. The developed methodology is foreseen as a valuable tool for the quantitative study of other bio-oils, considering the great complexity and high dimensionality of these samples.

abstract = {In the present study, biochar from spent coffee grounds was synthesized via pyrolysis at 850 degrees C for 1 h, characterized and employed as catalyst for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by persulfate activation. A variety of techniques, such as physisorption of N-2, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and potentiometric mass titration, were employed for biochar characterization. The biochar has a surface area of 492 m(2)/g, its point of zero charge is 6.9, while mineral deposits are limited. SMX degradation experiments were performed mainly in ultrapure water (UPW) at persulfate concentrations between 100 and 1000 mg/L, biochar concentrations between 50 and 200 mg/L, SMX concentrations between 500 and 2000 mu g/L and initial solution pH between 3 and 10. Real matrices, besides UPW, were also tested, namely bottled water (BW) and treated wastewater (WW), while synthetic solutions were prepared spiking UPW with bicarbonate, chloride, humic acid or alcohols. Almost complete removal of SMX can be achieved using 200 mg/L biochar and 1000 mg/L sodium persulfate (SPS) within 75 min. The presence of biochar is important for the degradation process, while the activity of the biochar increases linearly with SPS concentration. Degradation follows a pseudo-order kinetic model and the rate increases with increasing biochar concentration and decreasing SMX concentration. Although SMX adsorption onto the biochar surface is favored at acidic conditions, degradation proceeds equally fast regardless of the initial solution pH. Reactions in either real matrix are slower, resulting in 55{\%} SMX removal in 60 min for WW. Bicarbonate causes severe inhibition as only 45{\%} of SMX can be removed within 75 min in UPW. The addition of alcohol slightly inhibits degradation suggesting that the reaction pathway is either under electron transfer control or due to the generation of surface oxygen radicals with higher oxidation potential than the homogeneously produced radicals.},

The aim is to examine the associated advantages and drawbacks of each technique separately along with the assessment of process parameters affecting the efficiency of the generation of the bio-based products. Challenges faced during the processing of the wastes to each of the bio-products have been explained and future scopes stated. Among the many hurdles encountered in the successful and high yield generation of the bio-products is the complexity and variability in the composition of the food wastes along with the high inherent moisture content. Also, individual technologies have their own process configurations and operating parameters which may affect the yield and composition of the desired end product. All these require extensive study of the composition of the food wastes followed by their effective pre-treatments, judicial selection of the technological parameters and finally optimization of not only the process configurations but also in relation to the input food waste material. Attempt has also been made to address the hurdles faced during the implementation of such technologies on an industrial scale.},

abstract = {Coffee silverskin (CSS) has various nutritional and functional properties, enabling it for valuable applications. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an efficient and economic extraction technique. In this research, UAE was employed in the extraction of bioactive compounds from CSS with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent. Extraction efficacy between the UAE-treated extracts and the UAE-untreated (control) was assessed in terms of the total phenolic content (TPC), caffeine content, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), and antioxidant capacities. The yields of TPC were in the range from 5.80 ± 0.06 to 8.94 ± 0.01 mg GAE/g sample. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity were highly enhanced by applying UAE compared to the controls. Noticeable caffeine content in the range from 3.27 ± 0.10 to 4.29 ± 0.01 g/100 g sample was found in the CSS samples. CGAs (3-CGA, 4-CGA, and 5-CGA) were all quantified. Methanol–water extracts showed significantly (p {\textless}.05) higher TPC, caffeine content, and antioxidant capacity than water extracts. The micro-structure investigation of CSS indicated UAE can cause cell disruption and micro cracks so that it can be an effective extraction technique. Peleg's model showed a good fitting (R2 {\textgreater} 0.94) to the experimental results on the kinetics of UAE of phenolics compounds. Practical applications: Coffee is a most consumed beverage internationally. Due to its great production, large quantities of residues including coffee pulp and husk, coffee silver skin, and spent coffee grounds are generated in the coffee industry. Among them, coffee silverskin (CSS) is a by-product during the coffee roasting process, which contains nutritional and functional properties. As an efficient and economic novel extraction technique, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed in the current study to extract bioactive compounds from coffee silverskin with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent in order to overcome various disadvantages encountered by the conventional extraction methods. Results indicated that application of UAE pretreatment showed significantly higher recovery of phenolic compounds compared to the controls and high ultrasound intensity (38 W/cm2) was more effective in recovering polyphenols compared to 5 W/cm2 ultrasonic treatments. Therefore, results from the current study provide useful and practical information for the coffee industry.},

This big industry is believed to generate huge amount of waste with spent coffee grounds (SCGs) represents one of the main by-products. Recycling of such waste to fuels and value-added products through bio-refineries is a promising way to solve the problem of many countries that face daily challenges and heavy cost in waste disposal. This review aims to shadow the light on SCGs recycling potential in which over 230 published papers on SCGs recycling topic were gathered and discussed. Various opportunities to produce biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, bio-oil and fuel pellets besides value-added products such as bioactive compounds, adsorbents, polymers, nanocomposites, and compost were discussed. Moreover, the potential of membrane technology related to various processes of biorefining, separation and purification in the proposed SCG-integrated biorefinery are presented. Based on the presented review, it is obvious that recycling of SCGs offers many worthwhile options to policymakers that can contribute towards huge financial saving on taxpayers of running and maintaining landfills besides saving the environment from harmful emissions. In conclusion, this review emphasizes that SCG-integrated biorefineries to produce different types of biofuels and value-added products are a very promising approach that shall be economically more scrutinized in the foreseen future.},
