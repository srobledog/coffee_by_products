abstract = {During the cultivation and processing of coffee different residues can be obtained, such as, coffee cut-stems, coffee silverskin, spent coffee grounds, coffee pulp, and coffee husk. In the last years, some research has demonstrated that this type of biomass can be a good source of bioproducts through its transformation using stand-alone processes or biorefineries. In this sense, this chapter shows a description of coffee grain and an overview of the world production, consumption, and processing stages to obtain the by-products. In order to know the potential and identify the important compounds in the coffee processing, the physicochemical composition of by-products is analyzed. Thus, an analysis of possibilities of integral valorization of by-products as raw materials to obtain antioxidants, biofuels, bioenergy, bioproducts, and biofertilizers is performed. Finally, the biorefinery concept is considered to generate biochemicals and added-value products from the abovementioned residues, taking into account the design of biorefineries, the production scale, and a technical and economic assessment.},

abstract = {Coffee husk and coffee pulp are coffee processing by-products. Coffee husk is obtained when harvested coffee is processed by the dry method, and coffee pulp is produced by the wet method. In Brazil, coffee is usually processed by the dry method, therefore an expressive amount of husk is obtained every year. Some of the husk is used as organic fertilizer but, other applications are very limited, mainly because it is a bulky product. The presence of tannins and caffeine diminish acceptability and palatability of husk by animals. This review discuss degradation of caffeine by microorganisms, with special attention to bacterial, biological decaffeination of coffee husk and pulp and its subsequent use on animal feeding. The known biochemical routes of caffeine degradation by microorganisms are initially discussed; problems concerning physiological effects in animals, focusing on the limitations imposed by caffeine as an antiphysiological component are raised; the use of microorganisms to decaffeinate coffee husk and pulp is discussed. The discussions offer a view on decreasing caffeine content of coffee husk and pulp, which would allow the use of larger amounts of these products in animal feeding, partially replacing traditional components such as cereal grains. {\textcopyright} 2002, Scientia Agricola.

abstract = {Agro-industrial processing always generates waste materials. Coffee is one of the largest commodities in the world, and its processing yields coffee husk as waste by-product. Its disposal without proper treatment can cause serious environmental problems. Coffee husk contains carbohydrates including fermentable sugars, polyphenols such as tannins, lipids. Various microorganisms including filamentous fungi are reported to grow on it despite the presence of antimicrobial compounds. Chemical nature of coffee husk makes it a suitable and inexpensive source for solid-state fermentation. Several studies have been reported on the application of coffee husk in bioprocess. It acts as a substrate as well as carbon source during fermentation. Production of various enzymes such as xylanases, cellulases, polygalacturonases, polyphenol oxidases, tannases in high titers can be achieved by fermentation using coffee husk as substrate. Apart from production of enzymes, bioconversion of coffee husk is also achieved during bioprocess which in turn favors sustainable utilization of waste products. Production of citric acid, gibberellic acid, gallic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and bacterial cellulose is reported by fermentation using coffee husk as substrate. Mass production of microorganisms is another advantage of using coffee husk in bioprocess. It is excellent for the growth of various biocontrol agents such as Trichoderma sp. Besides economic production, prolonged shelf life of biocontrol agents multiplied on coffee husk makes it more attractive. Biopesticides such as Bacillus sphaericus and B. thuringiensis can also be produced by solid-state fermentation on coffee husk. The sustainable management of agro-industrial waste like coffee husk through bioprocess makes it as an attractive source of wealth.},

abstract = {The tradition in Colombia of processing coffee in each farm provides a source of residual biomass (coffee pulp) with a potential for transformation into synthesis gas through the process of biomass gasification, since 40{\%} of the weight of the harvested coffee is fresh pulp. The conceptual design, construction and commissioning of a downstream biomass gasifier was carried out with the aim of using coffee pulp as the source of biomass as it is readily available on all coffee farms. During the operation of the gasifier, the process gives rise to a combustible gas and biochar. The latter can be used for soil amelioration, in the coffee plantation, as well as being a means of sequestering atmospheric carbon. After the process of mechanical separation, the coffee pulp was submitted to solar drying after which it presented a uniform particle size, between 2 and 3 mm, ideal for use in fixed bed gasifiers. In this study, the coffee pulp was compared with two other sources of biomass; rice hulls and “cisco” (the outer skin of the coffee bean available from coffee processing factories. While the gasifier operates, the fuel gas is thermally harnessed through a heat exchanger, which heats the air stream to a constant temperature of 50 °C. The hot air is supplied to a traditional coffee dryer, where the coffee grains are dried to 12{\%} humidity for further packaging and marketing. It was evident during the tests that the gasifier needed a stabilization time to obtain a stream of stable and combustible synthesis gas. The dried coffee pulp produced a synthesis gas of more uniform quality as compared with the rice husks and the coffee husks. The time to stabilise the gas flow and the rate of consumption of biomass also favoured the use of coffee pulp compared with the other feedstocks. By contrast, the relative production rate of biochar was higher for rice husk compared with coffee pulp and cisco” which did not differ. The quality of the biochar, as indicated by its capacity to absorb water was also highest for the rice husk biochar. The coffee pulp was associated with a minimum degree of obstruction of the pipes by tar, in contrast to the coffee husks that produced more tar. Biochar contamination of the synthesis gas stream was also apparent when the fuel was rice husks or coffee husks due to their lower density compared to the coffee pulp. {\textcopyright} 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

The coffee husk conservation can be made by silage. Specific microorganisms can produce a standard ensilage when added in the process. The main goal of this work is to study the natural microflora present in the coffee husk and coffee pulp able to ensilage these by-products. The lactic acid bacteria responsible for this process were isolated and characterised and added in an ensilage process to accelerate the acid lactic production. First, in this work, fresh fruity coffee pulp were put fermented naturally and it was observed that the pH was maintained around 4 during two months. Then many bacteria were isolated from these natural fermented materials. Morphology, fermentative and biochemistry studies were used to identify and characterise the bacteria. These bacteria were able to grown in a coffee extract and change the pH 6 to around 4.4. Then, the second study was added these isolated bacteria in processed coffee husk to ensilage. It shows that is necessary to add the lactic acid bacteria to initiate the ensilage process. In the coffee husk fermentation, 10(7) CFU were added per g of matter and the pH was maintained around 4.8; microorganisms were viable for 2 months.},

abstract = {Introduction: Total coffee production in the world in 2013 was 8.7 million Mg of coffee beans. Coffee must be processed after harvest to separate beans from the husk, and the post-harvest process can generate different types of residues. Knowing that 50 {\%} of the harvested coffee is husk, it is important to consider that these by-products can contribute to environmental problems if not disposed of properly. There is a need to find alternatives to the piling of coffee husk as a means of disposal at coffee farms. The objectives in this experiment were to characterize five types of coffee processing residues and assess their value as potassium (K) fertilizer by examining K release. Results: Chemical characteristics of coffee residues varied with processing method, such as wet and dry processes. Application of residues to soil columns followed by 40 weeks of simulated leaching increased total K content in the soil for all treatments based on application rate, except for enriched and three-year composted coffee husk (3ycomp). Coffee processing residues had higher concentrations of K leached compared with the control with no K application, but only 3ycomp was higher than other coffee processing residues. Total K released from coffee residues increased linearly with application rate, but the decomposition of the coffee residues was low, which suggest that K release from coffee processing residues is not related to decomposition. Conclusion: Post-harvest coffee processes impacted concentrations of K, nitrogen, carbon, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, phenol, pH, and electrical conductivity among the coffee processing residues. The K release was high (over 90 {\%}), but it did not depend on the type of coffee processing residue, and thus, the residues can be a substitute for a mineral source of K applied to soils. The use of coffee processing residues as source of K did not prevent K losses by leaching. Some coffee residues resulted in greater K leaching than mineral KCl applied at the same rate. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

The scientific evidence which has proved the harm of this alkaloid has paved the way for innumerable research in the area of caffeine degradation. In addition to this, the fact that the by-products of the coffee and tea industry pollute the environment has called for the need of decaffeinating coffee and tea industry's by-products. Though physical and chemical methods for decaffeination are available, the lack of specificity for removal of caffeine in these techniques and their non-eco-friendly nature has opened the area of microbial and enzymatic degradation of caffeine. Another important application of microbial caffeine degradation apart from its advantages like specificity, eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness is the fact that this process will enable the production of industrially and medically useful components of the caffeine degradation pathway like theobromine and theophylline.

The production of edible mushrooms using coffee husks is an option for recovering this byproduct because of the fungi's ability to degrade these compounds and convert the lignocellulosic residues to food with high commercial and nutritional value.

abstract = {Food by-products happen at various stages of production and processing at home and on commercial scales. In the recent years, because of the fast-growing food companies and production, food processing by-products have gained a lot of interest and attracted many technical and health professionals as well as policy makers internally and internationally. Also, concerns are increasing about food by-products due to their ecological and environmental impact on the planet. This is particularly of concern when large companies emit. Large quantities of food by-products are thrown into environment in which they can be exploited technically, medicinally, and pharmaceutically. This is due to their chemical component and biologically active compounds of the by-products. Therefore, this systematic review focuses on the food by-product biological compounds present in different parts of the food products, particularly in some common foods such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, dairy products, meat, eggs, nuts, coffee, and tea. Moreover, the review also explains the kind of biologically active compounds and their quantity not just in edible foods, but also in part and types of the by-product which then can be reused and recycled into different processes in order to extract and get benefit from.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of replacing oat hay with coffee husk for the feeding of confined lambs. In this study, 24 male Texel lambs of approximately 60 days of age and with a mean +/- standard error weight of 21.95 +/- 5.81 kg were examined. Their diet was composed of 30{\%} oat hay and 70{\%} concentrated feed per kilogram of dry matter. The experimental design was randomized and included four treatments (0, 7.5, 15, and 22.5{\%} of coffee husk in the total dry matter), with six replicates of each treatment. The animals were slaughtered when they reached a mean live weight of 32 kg. There was no significant difference in dry matter intake and mean daily weight gain (which were 197 g day(-1)) among treatments. The mean daily weight gain (DWG) was not significantly affected (P {\textgreater} 0.05) by the replacement of oat hay with coffee husk in the diet, with the overall mean DWG being 215.05 g day(-1). There were no significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) among treatments in any of the studied carcass variables, and the mean true carcass yield was 53.9{\%}. The lambs presented a mean finishing score of 2.96 (on a scale of 1 to 5) and a conformation of 4.21 (on a scale of 1 to 6), characterizing them as good carcasses. In terms of economic viability, the 7.5{\%} diet stood out as the one that had the highest profitability, generating a profit of {\$} 3.25 USD per kg of carcass produced. Coffee husk can therefore replace oat hay in the feed of finishing lambs in concentrations of 0.075 to 0.225 kg kg-(1) of total dry matter with biological and economical efficacy and generating good commercial carcasses.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the putative effects of the use of coffee husk as floor covering on boar semen quality. Sixteen boars were divided into two groups. The first group was held in a conventional system with a compact floor. The second group was kept on a compact floor covered with coffee pods. The experimental period was 60 days. Levels of caffeine and chlorogenic acid in the insemination doses (ID) before and after 96 h of storage at 15 degrees C and the reproductive performance (litter size and rate of return to estrus) of these doses after their utilization in a standard artificial insemination protocol were evaluated. The ID from the animals kept in pens containing the coffee pods contained 25.4 +/- 8.7 mu g/mL of caffeine, whereas no significant amounts of chlorogenic acid were detected. Semen from boars housed with coffee husk showed a significant increase in malondialdehyde levels, which indicates a significant increase in cell membrane peroxidation, after 96 h of storage. There were no significant differences in the other evaluated semen quality parameters when analyzed among groups. Likewise, there was no significant influence of coffee hulls on either the rate of return to estrus or the litter size of inseminated females. The use of coffee husks as floor covering worsens the quality of fresh semen and that of insemination doses stored for 96 h but not the quality of semen immediately diluted; therefore, coffee husks may be used only on farms that use semen immediately processed after collection without affecting the reproductive parameters of breeding stock.},

The Province of Santiago de Cuba in southeast Cuba was the focus of this study; its existing operations, infrastructure, resource flows and scarcities, and actor relationships provide the basis of the data used for the evaluation. The authors investigated the regional context, identify potential members of an agricultural and agro-industrial network in three municipalities of the province, and identify the main residuals and by-products of key facilities. Potential avenues for by-product valorization are investigated along with the possible influence/impacts on the sustainability of the surrounding systems and actors. A conceptual model for a regional network for integrated food and energy production is then provided based upon the development of three agricultural/ agro-industrial scenarios: influence at the farm level, regional agro- industrial networks, and `anchor tenant' eco-industrial systems. The main challenges and opportunities for the development of the networks are described with recommendations for addressing such where possible.},

Screening of fungal organism for cellulase production was carried out and the potential organism was identified as Rhizopus stolonifer by internal transcribed spacer's (ITS)-5.8S rDNA analysis. A systematic study with response surface methodology (RSM) based on CCRD was used to study the interactions among the variables such as pH (3-7), moisture (40-80 {\%}) and progression duration (72-168 h) of the fermentation process to maximize the enzyme production. Under the optimized cultivation condition, R. stolonifer synthesized 22,109 U/gds. Model validations at optimum operating conditions showed excellent agreement between the experimental results and the predicted responses with a confidence level of 95 {\%}. Endoglucanase thus produced was utilized for ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and maximum of 65.5 g/L of ethanol was obtained. This fungal cellulase has also reported to be efficient detergent additives and promising for commercial use. The present study demonstrates coffee husk as a significant bioprocess substrate. Statistical optimization with major parameters for cellulase production can be highly applicable for industrial scale. Furthermore, value addition to coffee husk with sustainable waste management leading to environment conservation can be achieved.},

abstract = {Exoglucanase was produced using coffee husk, the by-product of coffee processing industries, as the sole carbon source using economical fermentation strategies like solid-state fermentation (SSF). The effects of process parameters such as pH, moisture and fermentation duration on exoglucanase synthesis was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) based on three factors and five level central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Statistical analysis revealed moisture and fermentation duration has significant effect on the exoglucanase production. The optimized conditions were pH 6.7, moisture 43.2{\%} and fermentation duration 99.8 hours. At these conditions, the predicted exoglucanase activity was 392.2 U/ml and the actual experimental value was 390.3 U/ml. The experimental value (390.3 U/ml) related well with the predicted one (392.2 U/ml) indicating the suitability of the model employed. The enzyme showed optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 40°C. The enzyme activity was enhanced in presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+. The effect of solvents and detergents on the enzyme activity was also studied. The results indicate excellent scope of utilizing coffee husk as solid substrate for commercial production of exoglucanase employing Rhizopus stolonifer. This investigation is the first report of utilizing coffee husk for the production of exoglucanase and is significantly higher than the values reported for other potent fungi and bacteria and their utilization by biotechnological resources assume social, economic and industrial importance. {\textcopyright} IDOSI Publications, 2012.},

abstract = {Data about coffee consumed world-wide are somewhat contradictory. A conservative estimate, suggests a number of around 8 mln tones per year. Its production involves a comparable amount of by-products, mainly pulp, husks, skins and spent coffee grounds. Thus, a sustainable coffee industry requires the development of methods for utilization of coffee by-products. Among these, the preparation of renewable fuel additives (e.g. biodiesel) and carbon adsorbents is a promising alternative to the eventual dumping of biogenic substances, harmful to the environment. Extraction of coffee by-products is the first step towards their utilization. This work presents results on laboratory extraction of spent coffee grounds (SCG) with different solvents, discussed in the context of the preparation of renewable fuel additives. The aim of the present study is to develop a procedure for extraction of coffee residues, suitable for production of biofuels and adsorbents.},

Substrate attributes and eucalyptus biomass production were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) to detect patterns of clustering. The different proportions of organic wastes influenced the physico-chemical characteristics of OWS and, consequently, the eucalyptus biomass production. The highest biomass was observed in one of the CS that is rich in available boron (B) and calcium (Ca), less concentrated in most of the nutrients and with low EC and Na+ contents. The PCA allowed the verification that B availability was the attribute that explained most of the variation in eucalyptus biomass production.},

The study pointed out that all of these wastes are materials of great potentiality for enzyme immobilization even if coconut fiber is preferred. This result is of significant interest due to the low cost and great availability of such wastes, which actually are underused and cause significant environmental problems for improper storage. In addition, the development of economic biocatalysts more sustainable, besides reduce environmental impacts, improve the application of enzymatic technology in industry.

abstract = {Purpose In this study, the composting and co-composting potential of coffee husk and pulp with source-separated municipal solid waste (SSMSW) was investigated. Methods Coffee husk and pulp were mixed independently with SSMSW in different proportions (0, 33, 50 and 100{\%}), and composted in triplicates with a total of 24 composting piles for 3 months. From each compost type, different physicochemical parameters were analyzed. In addition, the seed germination, growth and fresh head weight yield of each compost type were investigated on each matured compost type using cabbage seed (Brassica oleracea). Results The results indicate that the two coffee by-products can be composted alone or co-composted with SSMSW yielding very mature and stable compost. The results indicated that the addition of 1/4th of local soil (wt/wt) on C8 compost type yields the optimum fresh head weight of the cabbage among all field experiments. In addition, when C8 compost type is mixed with local soil in 3:1 ratio, it could yield an optimum fresh head weight of the cabbage (572 +/- 10 g/kg of compost). This could be due to the relatively higher concentration of total nitrogen in the C8 compost sample. Conclusions Generally, the final compost can be served for unrestricted type of agricultural purposes. Thus, co-composing of coffee husk and pulp with SSMSW can alleviate the multidimensional problems of rural and urban dwellers.},

abstract = {Biochar is the carbonaceous solid byproduct from thermal treatment of biomass that is produced specifically for application to soils. Studies have shown that when biochar is added to soils, it is able to increase yields, improve soil properties, and effectively store carbon for hundreds to thousands of years. This study compared the performance of biochar from five different feedstocks (coffee husks, maize cobs, eucalyptus wood, groundnut shells, and rice husks) produced in a traditional kiln and biochar from two different feedstocks (maize cobs and eucalyptus wood) produced in a downdraft gasifier. This research, conducted at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, was aimed at investigating the potential of biochar as a soil amendment in the humid tropics. Biochar samples were combined with undisturbed soil in a 45-day pot experiment to compare effects on maize growth. On average, soils amended with gasifier-produced biochar had higher yields than the unamended soil and soils amended with kiln-produced biochar. Comparing kiln-produced chars from different feedstocks, the coffee husk chars were the most productive. Results indicated that the soluble ash content of the biochar had the greatest influence on soil productivity. Ugandan soils, like most soils in the humid tropics, are strongly acidic (pH = 4.7), and the increase in pH caused by the soluble ash in the biochar provided for more favorable growing conditions and higher nutrient availability.
