abstract = {Eucalyptus growth was evaluated in five compost-based substrates formulated with different proportions of sewage sludge, coffee husk, peat, chicken manure, cattle manure, pine bark, sawdust, and coconut fiber, compared to two commercial substrates (CS). Organic wastes compost-based substrates (OWS) and CS were characterized regarding the available contents of macro and micronutrients, sodium (Na+), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bulk density (BD). Substrate attributes and eucalyptus biomass production were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) to detect patterns of clustering. The different proportions of organic wastes influenced the physico-chemical characteristics of OWS and, consequently, the eucalyptus biomass production. The highest biomass was observed in one of the CS that is rich in available boron (B) and calcium (Ca), less concentrated in most of the nutrients and with low EC and Na+ contents. The PCA allowed the verification that B availability was the attribute that explained most of the variation in eucalyptus biomass production.},
