abstract={This study sought to determine the content of phytosterols (PS) in spent coffee grounds (SCG) to assess a novel industrial application of this coffee by-product as a commercial source of PS. Four PS were extracted and analyzed from 14 SCG samples from 12 countries. Sonication in acidic conditions followed by saponification resulted determinant for PS extraction. PS were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) after derivatization. In the order of abundance, the PS were β-sitosterol (188.5–688.5 mg kg−1), campesterol (48.6–214.5 mg kg−1), stigmasterol (58.9–188.5 mg kg−1), and cycloartenol (14.6–65.8 mg kg−1 mg kg1). Total PS fraction ranged from 343.4 mg kg−1 to 1146.3 mg kg−1 of SCG with an average level of 618.2 ± 195.4 mg kg−1. Considering the millions of tons of SCG produced every year, this by-product could be a sustainable source of PS to fill a growing global demand. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To obtain the coffee beverage, approximately 90% of the edible parts of the coffee cherry are discarded as agricultural waste or by-products (cascara or husk, parchment, mucilage, silverskin and spent coffee grounds). These by-products are a potential source of nutrients and non-nutrient health-promoting compounds, which can be used as a whole ingredient or as an enriched extract of a specific compound. The chemical composition of by-products also determines food safety of the novel ingredients. To ensure the food safety of coffee by-products to be used as novel ingredients for the general consumer population, pesticides, mycotoxins, acrylamide and gluten must be analyzed. According with the priorities proposed by the Food Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to maximize the benefit for the environment, society and economy, food waste generation should be avoided in the first place. In this context, the valorization of food waste can be carried out through an integrated bio-refinery approach to produce nutrients and bioactive molecules for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and non-food applications. The present research is an updated literature review of the definition of coffee by-products, their composition, safety and those food applications which have been proposed or made commercially available to date based on their chemical composition. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Abstract: The spent coffee ground is a by-product of the coffee industry with high potential because of its beneficial properties for health, however, due to high water content, it is necessary to stabilize it without affecting bioactive capacities. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different convective drying conditions, on some technological and functional properties of the spent coffee ground and to determine the thermal degradation kinetics of chlorogenic acids. The methodology included the optimization of the drying process conditions of spent coffee ground: temperature (40–60 °C), air flow (1.0–2.0 m/s) and cake thickness (0.01–0.02 m). Effective diffusion coefficient, moisture, water activity, water and oil holding capacity, antioxidant capacity, caffeine, and seven chlorogenic acids were determined. The results showed that the best drying conditions were 60 °C, 2.0 m/s, 1.28 cm which allows retaining 84.24% of total polyphenols and 66.00% of the antioxidant capacity. Chlorogenic acids showed thermal degradation kinetics of first order under the optimal process conditions. In general, it is concluded that the convective drying process is a valid technique for processing of coffee grounds, as it allows the preservation of antioxidant compounds with a potentially beneficial effect on health, providing a stabilized low moisture content that can be used in food applications.

abstract={BACKGROUND: The total amount of bio-waste produced annually in the EU by the food and beverage chains is estimated at 37 billion kg. The use of insects for the valorization of by-products from these value chains may represent a sustainable solution. This study aimed to investigate the by-products obtained from different food chains and used for the rearing of black soldier fly (BSF) prepupae, and to evaluate the content and profile of the lipid extracted from the prepupae and outline its possible applications. The substrates used in this experiment were: (i) industrial by-products (brewery spent grains, cows’ milk whey, grape stalks, and tomato peels and seeds) and (ii) by-products from retailers (bread dough, fish scraps, and spent coffee ground). Fat extracted from prepupae using an adjusted Folch method was used for total lipid content and fatty acid profile. RESULTS: The best larval performances were obtained from beer (0.22 gweight per prepupa), tomato (0.19 gweight per prepupa), and cheese (0.14 gweight per prepupa) food-chain by-products. The extremely different compositions of the substrates were reflected in the differentiated lipid profile of the BSF prepupae and in the range of ratios between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, which varied from 0.37 for cows’ milk whey to 1.34 for tomato peels and seeds. CONCLUSION: The lipids, proteins, and chitin extracted from prepupae are high-value bio-based products that could be used in the feed / food industry or for the development of innovative biomaterials, such as biodiesel. These results suggest that food-chain by-products are the best candidates for insect-bioconversion purposes. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) represent one of the main residues derived from restoration and hostelry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SCG, included in the concentrate at different concentrations (0, 30, 50 and 100 g/kg), on milk yield and quality, feeding behaviour, dry matter intake, apparent digestibility and ruminal short chain fatty acid profile. In this trial of 51 days of duration, 48 Latxa dairy ewes were used. The ewes were blocked in quartets according to milk yield (1918 ± 287 g) and days in milk (35.7 ± 8.9 days). All of the concentrates were formulated to be isoenergetic (1.01 UFL), isoproteic (166 g/kg), isofat (76 g/kg) and to meet the production needs. The concentrate was given in two doses of 450 g of dry matter during the morning and afternoon milkings, and fescue hay was offered ad libitum. Milk production was recorded and samples were taken for fat, protein and lactose composition analysis. Dry matter intake and apparent dry matter digestibility were estimated using two markers, and feeding behaviour data was recorded. Increasing doses of SCG in the concentrate up to 100 g/kg resulted in a linear (P < 0.001) increase in the rumen of the isovaleric and isobutyric acid contents which could explain the observed quadratic response (P < 0.001) in milk yield and a linear increase (P < 0.001) in milk protein. A linear increase (P < 0.001) in milk fat was found which could be explained by the observed linear increase (P < 0.001) in ruminal acetic and butyric acid contents. Increasing doses of SCG in the concentrate linearly decreased ruminal (P < 0.001) propionic acid content, resulting in a concomitant linear increase (P < 0.001) in acetic:propionic ratio. Furthermore, no differences were found in intake, apparent dry matter digestibility and feeding behaviour. In conclusion, inclusion of SCG up to 100 g/kg in the concentrate modified ruminal fermentation pattern towards an increase in isoacids and acetic and butyric acid contents in the rumen with a concomitant improvement in milk production and composition without impairing feeding behaviour or apparent digestibility. © 2020},

abstract={The coffee plant Coffea spp. offers much more than the well-known drink made from the roasted coffee bean. During its cultivation and production, a wide variety of by-products are accrued, most of which are currently unused, thermally recycled, or used as animal feed. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of novel coffee products in the food sector and their current legal classification in the European Union (EU). For this purpose, we have reviewed the literature on the composition and safety of coffee flowers, leaves, pulp, husk, parchment, green coffee, silver skin, and spent coffee grounds. Some of these products have a history of consumption in Europe (green coffee), while others have already been used as traditional food in non-EU-member countries (coffee leaves, notification currently pending), or an application for authorization as novel food has already been submitted (husks, flour from spent coffee grounds). For the other products, toxicity and/or safety data appear to be lacking, necessitating further studies to fulfill the requirements of novel food applications. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Microwave heating is a part of several food processing unit-operations, while also emerging as a processing technology for by-products. Process efficiency depends on dielectric properties; however, data of these by-products are scarce in literature. The present study is focused on the effect of temperature and moisture content (M) on the dielectric constant (ε′) and loss (ε′′) of carrot waste, apple pomace, pineapple peel and spent coffee grounds at 2.45 GHz. Results onε′ showed moisture-dependent temperature effect with an inflection point atM= 50.3%. Theε′′ increased with increasingMup to 60% and decreased at higher moisture levels. Results at different temperatures were significantly affected by the composition of the studied materials and thus the calculated power penetration depth. Although fresh food dielectric properties are available in literature, the data is not always suitable to estimate food waste properties as processing may cause compositional changes. The obtained results support microwave process optimization in the field of food-waste valorization. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.},

abstract={Mexico is one of the world leaders in the production of coffee, but research on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity in Mexican coffee has been extremely limited and, importantly, the effect of organic farming on these properties has not been widely studied. Spent coffee grounds (SCG), the main by-product of coffee brewing, represent a serious environmental problem, but could become an important source of bioactive compounds for the pharmaceutical and food-processing industry. The aim of this work was, therefore, to study the effect of organic farming on bioactive and antioxidant properties of SCG; comparing samples of organic and conventionally grown coffee from the Mexican states of Veracruz and Chiapas, both of which produce coffee with the ‘Protected Designation of Origin’ distinction. Concentrations of total phenolic compound and total flavonoid compounds, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline 6- sulphonic-acid) antioxidant activity, and brown compound concentration were determined in SCG. Repeated measures ANOVAs were carried out on the data. Organic SCG samples showed significantly higher bioactive compound concentration (p < 0.01) and antioxidant activity (p < 0.001) than conventional SCG samples. This difference held across various extractions and the two geographical locations. Thus, this Mexican organic coffee by-product may represent an interesting source of such compounds for diverse industrial applications. Given that Mexico is one of the top producers of organic coffee in the world, there is a need for further research to consider other important variables, such as the type of coffee processing by-product and the type of coffee extraction process. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

These byproducts and coproducts spontaneously undergo chemical, biochemical, or microbial deteriorations due to high storage-temperatures, and consequently are turned into direct animal feed sources or even just treated as waste with eutrophication activity. This review provides an overview of selected mass-produced botanical food byproducts and coproducts (BFBC) including soybean okara, wheat germ, banana, and spent coffee grounds, with respect to value-added sustainable processing via proper drying technologies being employed. This review includes the current production of the above-mentioned agricultural products, the nutritional aspects of them, and the sustainable utilization of their coproducts. Additionally, the possible drying kinetics for value-added prospects are discussed. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) and spent tea leaves (STL) are constantly rejected either on a domestic scale or more widely on an industrial level. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the potential use of their aqueous extracts as organic priming agents in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in vitro germination under salt (NaCl, 102.66 mM) or drought (PEG 6000, 4%) stress for 384 h. Extraction from SCG and STL were achieved by three conventional techniques (infusion, boiling and incubation at room temperature). Thereafter, different concentrations from each by-product were examined. The results showed that, under salt stress, STL extract at 1.5% dry tea leaves (DTL), obtained by infusion extraction, displayed the best response in terms of final germination percentage (FGP), time taken for cumulative germination to reach 50% of its maximum (t50) and germination uniformity (U7525), whereas, the best improve in root length was obtained with 2.25% DTL compared with unprimed culture. Against drought stress, SCG extract at 4% dry coffee ground (DCG), obtained following incubation extraction, resulted in amelioration in FGP and U7525, however, 2% DCG engendered the best stimulation of growth. Added directly to the medium culture, STL (1.5% DTL) caused a highly significant inhibition of the germination process with both types of stress. However, SCG (2% DCG) supplementation is recommended mainly in drought stress to improve seedlings growth. Organic priming and medium supplementation can be alternative pathways for SCG and STL wastes valorization. Furthermore, these techniques can be a good cropping practice to improve seed potentiality against environmental challenges in sustainable agriculture.

abstract={In response to increasing waste production and commodities prices, greater attention is being paid to the utilization of waste streams as a source for raw materials and energy. Researchers have developed technologically and economically viable alternate end-of-life (EOL) strategies for a number of formerly landfilled byproducts. One in particular, spent coffee grounds (SCG), has shown promise in a wide variety of applications including ethanol production, biodiesel production and anaerobic digestion. However, no research has been done to assess the environmental impacts of these scenarios. The study looked at the 18 ReCiPe 2008 midpoint indicators and as well as the cumulative energy demand and found that the production of biodiesel, ethanol and glycerin from spent coffee grounds actually had a negative effect on the amount of CO2 eq produced and the energy demanded. While the methodology is customized to the conditions at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the methodology can be applied to other campuses, cities or municipalities with alterations based on the consideration of local conditions and resources. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) represent an environmental problem, although their composition makes them an interesting, re-valuable product to be incorporated in food. In this work, texture characteristics, proximate composition, total phenolic compounds (TPCs) content, and antioxidant activity were evaluated in cookies added with SCG (0.0, 10.0, 17.5 and 25.0 g/100 g). Intensity of specific sensory characteristics in cookies added with SCG was evaluated by 131 consumers using the just-about-right scale. Texture characteristics were not affected by SCG content. Crude fiber, fat, ash and TPC content increased with the increment of SCG in cookies (p <.01). All the cookies added with SCG were pleasant for consumers, although cookies with 17.5 g SCG /100 g were preferred (p <.05). Intensity of coffee flavor and granulosity seemed to determine its acceptance. Adding 17.5 and 25.0 g SCG/100 g in cookies allows to obtain a product acceptable for consumers, considered as dietary fiber source. Practical applications: Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are considered an underutilized by-product by its high content of fiber and presence of antioxidant compounds. During development of functional foods, it is recommendable that the product shows an attractive composition, but also enjoyable sensory characteristics, which make it acceptable for consumers. Inclusion of SCG in cookies is a viable alternative for adding value to this by-product, reducing waste, and, at the same time, obtaining an interesting, functional food. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Novel kinds of bio composite Phase change materials were prepared by the use of bio-wastes. Of the by-products, coffee wastes, which is currently consumed and abandoned as coffee as a drink, was used as the supporting material for PCM. It was found through chemical composition of FTIR of SCBW, SCPW, SCGW and that the coffee wastes were effectively vacuum impregnated into each natural wax. As a result of TGA, the thermal stability of SCBW, SCPW, SCGW and SCNW was checked. In addition, the DSC results were used to determine the heat storage performance of each material. Micro-morphological analysis with FE-SEM showed whether the impregnation was successful. The use of bio-compatible PCM by-products is economical as well as environmentally friendly and is sufficient for building applications in terms of thermal performance compared to other bio-composites. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Coffee is the second largest traded commodity after petroleum and the second most popular beverage after water. This big industry is believed to generate huge amount of waste with spent coffee grounds (SCGs) represents one of the main by-products. Recycling of such waste to fuels and value-added products through bio-refineries is a promising way to solve the problem of many countries that face daily challenges and heavy cost in waste disposal. This review aims to shadow the light on SCGs recycling potential in which over 230 published papers on SCGs recycling topic were gathered and discussed. Various opportunities to produce biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, bio-oil and fuel pellets besides value-added products such as bioactive compounds, adsorbents, polymers, nanocomposites, and compost were discussed. Moreover, the potential of membrane technology related to various processes of biorefining, separation and purification in the proposed SCG-integrated biorefinery are presented. Based on the presented review, it is obvious that recycling of SCGs offers many worthwhile options to policymakers that can contribute towards huge financial saving on taxpayers of running and maintaining landfills besides saving the environment from harmful emissions. In conclusion, this review emphasizes that SCG-integrated biorefineries to produce different types of biofuels and value-added products are a very promising approach that shall be economically more scrutinized in the foreseen future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Coffee silverskin (CSS) has various nutritional and functional properties, enabling it for valuable applications. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an efficient and economic extraction technique. In this research, UAE was employed in the extraction of bioactive compounds from CSS with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent. Extraction efficacy between the UAE-treated extracts and the UAE-untreated (control) was assessed in terms of the total phenolic content (TPC), caffeine content, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), and antioxidant capacities. The yields of TPC were in the range from 5.80 ± 0.06 to 8.94 ± 0.01 mg GAE/g sample. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity were highly enhanced by applying UAE compared to the controls. Noticeable caffeine content in the range from 3.27 ± 0.10 to 4.29 ± 0.01 g/100 g sample was found in the CSS samples. CGAs (3-CGA, 4-CGA, and 5-CGA) were all quantified. Methanol–water extracts showed significantly (p &lt;.05) higher TPC, caffeine content, and antioxidant capacity than water extracts. The micro-structure investigation of CSS indicated UAE can cause cell disruption and micro cracks so that it can be an effective extraction technique. Peleg's model showed a good fitting (R2 &gt; 0.94) to the experimental results on the kinetics of UAE of phenolics compounds. Practical applications: Coffee is a most consumed beverage internationally. Due to its great production, large quantities of residues including coffee pulp and husk, coffee silver skin, and spent coffee grounds are generated in the coffee industry. Among them, coffee silverskin (CSS) is a by-product during the coffee roasting process, which contains nutritional and functional properties. As an efficient and economic novel extraction technique, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed in the current study to extract bioactive compounds from coffee silverskin with water and methanol–water mixture as solvent in order to overcome various disadvantages encountered by the conventional extraction methods. Results indicated that application of UAE pretreatment showed significantly higher recovery of phenolic compounds compared to the controls and high ultrasound intensity (38 W/cm2) was more effective in recovering polyphenols compared to 5 W/cm2 ultrasonic treatments. Therefore, results from the current study provide useful and practical information for the coffee industry. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Agrifood by-products are perfect candidates to be further processed under the concept of circular economy, in order to produce their valorization. Although significant amounts of food-related wastes that are discarded are produced worldwide, these might still be rich in valuable compounds. A strategy to further valorize agrifood-related by-products is based on pyrolysis processes. The result of this process is a liquid product termed bio-oil which is composed of an organic phase and an aqueous phase. This bio-oil is rich on a variety of components and its analysis implies several challenges. In this work, quantitative on-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) is proposed for the first time to characterize several aqueous phases of different bio-oils. Rice husk, peanut shell, spent coffee grounds, peach core and Eucalyptus sawdust biomasses were analyzed. The developed quantitative LC × LC method presented very good linearity, precision, reproducibility, recovery and LODs and LOQs as low as 0.05 μg mL−1 and 0.16 μg mL−1, respectively. As much as 28 components were simultaneously separated and quantified in those samples. Our results found that the composition of these bio-oils was different but strongly related to the agrifood by-product submitted to pyrolysis. The developed methodology is foreseen as a valuable tool for the quantitative study of other bio-oils, considering the great complexity and high dimensionality of these samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) generated after coffee extraction are the main byproduct of the coffee industry. Valorization of the SCG has been increasingly focused following considerable attention in coffee consumption. Lactic acid bacteria fermentation is the primary source of generation of lactic acid, a monomer of polylactic acid that has various industrial applications; however, because of the low tolerance of lactic acid bacteria to toxic compounds, it is necessary to apply Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce lactic acid whose tolerance to toxic compounds is higher. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using SCG as substrate for the production of lactic acid by S. cerevisiae strain expressing heterologous lactate dehydrogenase. The fermentation profiles of the engineered yeast showed that lactic acid production was promoted by xylose addition. From simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using a whole slurry of acid-pretreated SCG, containing high amounts of hemicellulose fractions, lactic acid (0.11 g) and ethanol (0.10 g) per g SCG were obtained after 24 h of SSF, of which yields were 413% and 221% higher, respectively, than those of washed pretreated SCG. Thus, fermentation of whole slurry SCG by engineered S. cerevisiae is a suitable way of lactic acid production, selectively. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, thus being a rather relevant food commodity from an economic standpoint. In the coffee processing chain, from plant to cup, a series of by-products are generated in significant amounts with the major ones being husks, parchment husks, chaff (silverskin), and spent coffee ground (SCGs). Currently, these by-products are being underutilized in low-cost applications, e.g., ingredients for animal feed, substrate for composting and vermicomposting, and feedstock for in-farm or coffee industry combustion systems. The knowledge of the physical state and the chemical composition of each specific by-product is essential to define a path for its adequate exploitation. Coffee production and processing by-products present distinct physical and chemical characteristics, however, with a common distribution of classes of compounds among them, with carbohydrates comprising the major fraction, followed by proteins, lipids, ashes, polyphenols and caffeine. Thus, all the by-products are suitable for further profitable exploitation with current proposals for such valorization encompassing recovery of potential food ingredients, recovery and production of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, production of composite materials and films, production of adsorbents and catalysts, and production of biofuels. Thus, a critical overview of the current proposals is herein presented and future directions are suggested. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Microwave-assisted extraction is currently one of the most studied techniques for biomolecule recovery from natural sources, due to its favorable features for the treatment of thermo-sensitive compounds. In this work, the kinetic of antioxidant extraction from spent coffee grounds was investigated, focusing the attention on the effects of initial thermal ramp on the total polyphenol concentration, total solids and antiradical power of the final product. The hydro-alcoholic extracts demonstrated to be very rich of antioxidants with high antiradical power (from 0.45 to 0.88 μ Trolox equivalent /g dried spent coffee grounds ), and their quality was significantly affected by the investigated variables. Peleg's model, was successfully used to describe extraction kinetics, whose investigation revealed that 10 min of heating time at 423 K provided the highest concentration of polyphenols, and resulted as a good compromise to perform a fast extraction with high extraction yields (43 mg Caffeic Acid Equivalent /g dried spent coffee grounds after 60 min of extraction). © 2019},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds are a rich source of antioxidants and caffeine, which recovery and application in cosmetic field could lead to the formulation of healthier and cheaper products. Indeed, this by-product of food industry is available worldwide in huge amount, already in powder form, reducing the pretreatments required before extraction process. By microwave-assisted extraction is possible to enhance antioxidant extraction yields even when eco-friendly solvents are used. The purposes of this study were the optimization of the antioxidant extraction process, the analysis of its kinetics, and the production of a biocompatible extract to be potentially used in cosmetics. In this work, a first optimization was carried out on the solvent composition, temperature and extraction time by response surface methodology. The extract with the highest bioactive molecule content (32 mg/L of caffeine; 9 mg/L of chlorogenic acid), obtained at 150 °C, 90 min of extraction time and using ethanol/water 54:46 (v/v) as solvent, was tested on human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 in order to assess its biocompatibility. In addition, utilizing the optimal conditions for solvent composition and temperature, the kinetic of extraction was studied and Peleg's model well described experimental results, allowing to observe that an extraction time of 60 min was actually sufficient to reach the maximum polyphenol yield (46 ± 2.9 mgcaffeic acid equivalent/gdried solid). © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Coffee is the second largest traded commodity after oil and large amounts of by-products are generated in the coffee industry every year. In particular, coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the main coffee industry residues. CS is about 4.2% (w/w) of coffee beans and the valorisation of this waste through the biorefinery approach may boost the circular economy development. In the present contribution, CS was pretreated with one of the mainly investigated biomass pretreatment reported in literature: alkaline hydrolysis in NaOH solutions. After enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated CS, the obtained sugars were used as carbon source to produce butanol and isopropanol by Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423. Moreover, fermentation tests were also carried out with synthetic media to investigate the effects of the alkaline pretreatment on the fermentation process. When pretreated CS was used as feedstock, the largest yields were 0.16 and 0.31 gsolvent/gsugars isopropanol and butanol, respectively. The reported results foster further studies regarding the reuse of CS for solvents production through fermentation processes. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={Use of organic amendments is a good strategy for combating the growing problem of soil degradation due to deterioration of organic matter content, particularly severe in semi-arid European Mediterranean regions, while at the same time providing an opportunity for recycling organic wastes. Olive mill pomace (OMP), the main by-product of the olive oil industry, is being used increasingly in olive grove soils for this purpose. Although the positive effects of OMP amendments have been widely studied, they also have some negative effects on soil. One of the most critical is that they increase water repellency (WR) due to the presence of poorly evolved, strongly aliphatic compounds. This detrimental effect has received very little attention, although it may impair plant water availability and infiltration rates, increase erosion and lower long-term soil quality. This study proposed, for the first time, thermal treatment as an effective way of reducing WR in organic amendments (i.e. mixtures of OMP, olive tree pruning, chicken manure and spent coffee grounds) prior to their application to soil. Thermal treatment at 275 °C proved effective in removing WR, while lower temperatures (175 or 225 °C) can even increase it. Changes by thermal treatment in the characteristics of the organic amendments studied with FTIR and UV–Vis spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed that it strongly reduced the aliphatic compounds mainly responsible for their hydrophobicity, concentrated aromatic compounds and increased thermostability. Heating also reduced phytotoxicity, making all of the organic amendments usable in the field (germination index over 100%). Therefore, heating at 275 °C could be an acceptable option for removing WR from organic amendments, enhancing their quality with more stable evolved characteristics. © 2017},

abstract={spent coffee grounds (SCG) are considered valuable by-products because they contain various bioactive compounds. The SCG extraction (SCGE) was irradiated at doses ranging between 30 and 50 kGy. The deep dark-brown color of SCGE was changed to a bright yellow color by gamma irradiation. The content of the bioactive compounds of gamma-irradiated SCGE was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Interestingly, the content of quinic acid was increased by gamma irradiation, whereas other compounds were decreased. Although the contents of bioactive compounds were changed by gamma irradiation, the biological activities (radical scavenging activity and whitening effects) of SCGE were unaffected. Our findings suggest that gamma irradiation can effectively improve the color values of SCGE without the loss of biological activities. Consequently, gamma irradiation can be a useful tool for improving the utilization of SCGE in the cosmetic industry.},

abstract={Here in this study, co-pyrolysis of paper mill sludge (PMS) and spent coffee ground (SCG) was conducted to mainly recover energy and additionally produce engineered biochar as an adsorbent. More specifically, to enhance the generation of syngas (H2 and CO) through co-pyrolysis of PMS and SCG and modify the physico-chemical properties of biochar, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as reaction medium. The CO2 co-feeding impact on co-pyrolysis with various mass ratios of PMS and SCG was also evaluated to explore any catalytic effects arising from CO2 and Fe/Ca species in PMS. The decrease in pyrolytic oil substances was apparent due to the synergistic effects of CO2 and Fe/Ca species. Moreover, the generation of CO was catalytically enhanced in the presence of Fe/Ca species in PMS. Co-pyrolysis in CO2 not only converted the impregnated Fe ions into magnetite (Fe3O4), but also created porous biochar. One biochar fabricated at the optimal mass ratio (PMS:SCG = 7:3) exhibited the highest adsorption capability toward As(V) due to adequate balancing between the amount of Fe/Ca solid minerals and biochar porosity. As a result, co-pyrolysis using CO2 as reaction medium can be a feasible option for the generation of CO along with production of biochar as a byproduct which can be used in environmental application. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The production of phosphoric acid from phosphate rock leads to an industrial by-product called phosphogypsum (PG). One ton of phosphoric acid generates 5 tons of PG that is frequently stocked near the production units. Several attempts were made to test PG valorization via soil amendment because of its phosphate, sulphate and calcium content. In this study, the use of PG in composting was envisaged. Composts were produced by mixing olive oil wastes and spent coffee grounds. Two concentrations of PG, 10% (A10) and 30% (A30), were tested in composting substrate in addition to control compost without PG (AT). After 8 months of fermentation, the resulting composts were used in field experiments using nine different treatments conducted to evaluate the potential use of these PG-containing composts in potato plant (cv. Spunta) cultivation. Plants were grown in the field and the different composts (AT, A10 and A30) were added as fertilizer and compared to commercial compost and cattle manure. During the culture period, a number of physiological (dry weight, chlorophyll content, tuber yield) and biochemical parameters (antioxidant activities, mineral content, starch and protein content) were followed. Similarly, chlorophyll content was measured in plants cultivated on commercial or PG supplemented composts. An increment of 55.17% in potato yield was recorded with the use of A30 the compost. Collectively, these data reveal the positive impact of the addition of PG in composting which may be adopted as a strategy for PG valorization and its use for the production of high quality edible products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper investigates the strength and microstructure properties of spent coffee grounds stabilized with rice husk ash and slag geopolymers to produce a green construction subgrade material. Spent coffee grounds (CG) and rice husk ash (RHA) are organic wastes derived from agricultural products. CG is the residue from ground coffee beans. RHA is a by-product from the burning rice husk used to generate electricity. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (S) is a waste by-product derived from steel production. RHA and S were used as geopolymeric precursors (P). This study provides an insight on the long-term strength performance and microstructural formation of geopolymers synthesized from agricultural waste products. The influence factors studied were liquid alkaline activator content (L), RHA content, S content, temperature and curing time. By observing the strength development of CG-RHA geopolymers for up to 90 days, it was found that elevated temperature curing was needed for these CG:RHA geopolymers to develop long-term strengths. Test results show that an optimum mix of CG:RHA:S 70:20:10 cured at 50 °C can achieve an Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of 2 MPa after 90 days of curing. The outcome of this research will enable CG, S and RHA waste products to be used as sustainable materials in pavement applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Natural phenol polymers are widely represented in nature and include a variety of classes including tannins and lignins as the most prominent. Largely consumed foods are rich sources of phenol polymers, notably black foods traditionally used in East Asia, but other non-edible, easily accessible sources, e.g., seaweeds and wood, have been considered with increasing interest together with waste materials from agro-based industries, primarily grape pomace and other byproducts of fruit and coffee processing. Not in all cases were the main structural components of these materials identified because of their highly heterogeneous nature. The great beneficial effects of natural phenol-based polymers on human health and their potential in improving the quality of food were largely explored, and this review critically addresses the most interesting and innovative reports in the field of nutrition and biomedicine that have appeared in the last five years. Several in vivo human and animal trials supported the proposed use of these materials as food supplements and for amelioration of the health and production of livestock. Biocompatible and stable functional polymers prepared by peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols, as well as natural phenol polymers were exploited as conventional and green plastic additives in smart packaging and food-spoilage prevention applications. The potential of natural phenol polymers in regenerative biomedicine as additives of biomaterials to promote growth and differentiation of osteoblasts is also discussed. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={This chapter describes the steps involved in coffee processing from the field to the cup and the respective generation of by-products along the chain. The chemical composition of coffee husks, pulp, immature, and defective beans, coffee silverskin, and spent coffee grounds is detailed and methods for the sustainable management of these by-products are addressed, as well as legislative frameworks and policy recommendations. Although coffee by-products have a high potential of application in different fields, more integrated strategies with the involvement of coffee producers, industries, academic institutions, governmental and nongovernmental organizations are still needed to convert coffee by-products into really profitable substrates. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The world consumption of coffee generates large amounts of by-products. However, the use of these wastes for animal feed has not been possible due to the presence of antiphysiological and antinutritional factors, such as tannins and caffeine. Nevertheless, coffee silverskin (CS), spent coffee grounds (SCGs), coffee husks, and immature/defective coffee beans, the industrial by-products of coffee processing, have a potential use in skin-care formulations, based on their high content of bioactive compounds. On the other hand, considering that life expectancy has increased in developed countries, raising new concerns about skin and body appearance, the demand for cosmetics with natural ingredients is stronger than ever, representing a challenge for the worldwide economy and society. This chapter revises the potential application of bioactive compounds from coffee by-products to active ingredients for skin-care products. Their potential UV protective action, emollient capacity, antiwrinkle, and antimicrobial activities are critically reviewed and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The search for new substrates to be used in biotechnological processes has grown in recent years, especially, for the bioprocesses in which microorganisms are used to produce value-added products. In this scenario, the coffee processing by-products, wastewater, pulp, mucilage, husk, silverskin, and spent coffee ground, appear as interesting alternative substrate to be used in bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast cultivation. The composition of the coffee processing by-products including water-soluble sugars, proteins, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, oils, etc., allows its microbial conversion into products, such as ethanol, acids (lactic, citric, gibberellic, and gallic), aromatic volatile compounds (terpenes, higher alcohols, and esters), pigments (carotenoids), microbial biomass (edible mushroom), and enzymes. In this context, the current chapter presents several examples of coffee processing by-products used as substrate for the cultivation of microorganisms with an ultimate goal to generate value-added products. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={During the cultivation and processing of coffee different residues can be obtained, such as, coffee cut-stems, coffee silverskin, spent coffee grounds, coffee pulp, and coffee husk. In the last years, some research has demonstrated that this type of biomass can be a good source of bioproducts through its transformation using stand-alone processes or biorefineries. In this sense, this chapter shows a description of coffee grain and an overview of the world production, consumption, and processing stages to obtain the by-products. In order to know the potential and identify the important compounds in the coffee processing, the physicochemical composition of by-products is analyzed. Thus, an analysis of possibilities of integral valorization of by-products as raw materials to obtain antioxidants, biofuels, bioenergy, bioproducts, and biofertilizers is performed. Finally, the biorefinery concept is considered to generate biochemicals and added-value products from the abovementioned residues, taking into account the design of biorefineries, the production scale, and a technical and economic assessment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This chapter explores the possibilities of using coffee processing by-products (e.g., coffee husks and spent coffee grounds [SCG]) for energy applications (e.g., biofuels, biodiesel, bioethanol). In particular, the recovery of energy from biomass through thermochemical processes (pyrolysis, gasification, combustion, hydrothermal treatment, etc.) and biochemical processes is presented. The energy recovery from biomass is an ecological route to produce energy from renewable sources, reduce waste, produce cleaner-burning fuels, protect the environment, reduce fossil fuels consumption and dependence, decrease fuel costs, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and find a solution for the limited availability of fossil fuels. Moreover, it has a good impact on economic, social, and agricultural development and ensures a regular supply of energy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) and coffee silverskins (CSS) are two high-volume industrial by-products rich in valuable components, such as alkaloids, diterpenic, and phenolic compounds, triglycerides (oils), and polysaccharides. Their recovery yield and purity are highly dependent on the selected extraction method and operating conditions. This chapter discusses recent advances on the following separation technologies: solid-liquid extraction (SLE) using conventional solvents and ionic liquids, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), subcritical water extraction, ultrasound assisted extraction, and microwave assisted extraction. SLE and SFE are the most mature approaches for the extraction of coffee by-products, although promising results have been reported for the other technologies. Solvents like ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents are expected to play an important role in the near future, along with other approaches, such as pervaporation, nanofiltration, sorption (adsorption and ion exchange), hydrothermal liquefaction, pulsed electric fields extraction, and products synthesis under the scope of nanotechnology. Overall, these methods produce oils/extracts rich in phenolic compounds exhibiting valuable antioxidant activity levels, with encouraging extraction yields. The optimization of both operating conditions and unit's arrangement is crucial to ensure their technological and economic viability. Currently, a considerable number of scientific studies and patents demonstrate or claim their use for various applications, including dermatological formulations, pest control formulations, growth enhancer substrates for bacterial cultures, biodiesel production, among others. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Coffee may be the most popular beverage brewed from roasted bean. However, its producing generates various by-products, such as pulp, husk, sliver silk, mucilage, and spent coffee grounds (SCG). Among them, SCG (known as exhausted coffee residue) is significantly generated from soluble coffee factories and commercial coffee shops. This chapter explores the possibilities of utilizing SCG as a precursor for the production of biochar via pyrolysis. In addition, its potential agricultural and fabric applications are also reviewed taking into account that it is a carbon-rich and nutrient-enriched material. Initially, the thermochemical conversion of biomass into various energy forms and the biochar characterization are described. The exhausted coffee residue and its potential utilization for the production of various energy forms were then addressed. The pyrolysis process for the sustainable management of exhausted coffee residue is further reviewed. Finally, the thermochemical properties of exhausted coffee residue and its resulting biochar are summarized. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are abundant, low-cost and versatile feedstocks for a wide range of high-valued end products. With a goal to achieve zero waste, this study aims to further broaden the diversity by using the residue for bioactive components, biodiesel production, as well as for the manufactures of activated carbon and fuel pellet. The analyzed SCG oil was rich in palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for more than 50 % of the oil composition. Among different extraction methods, microwave-Assisted extraction (MAE) was found to be recommended for maximal yields of SCG's oil (17.00 %) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (31.15 mg quercetin/g); while ultrasound-Assisted extraction (UAE) was more efficient toward the recovery of lipid hydroperoxide (LP) (0.0191 mM) and total phenolic content (TPC) (13.500 mg AG/g). Optimal SCG-over-solvent ratio was another studied parameter. The research also confirmed the antioxidant capability of the coffee grounds. The production of SCG's biodiesel followed the conventional esterification and transesterification processes. The assessment of the fuel complied with the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM 6751); and most of the analyzed values satisfied the standards. The activated carbon (AC) generated from SCG demonstrated a comparable purification capacity. The BET surface area and total pore volume were 1,547 m2/g and 0.225 cm3/g. For optimal area's value, a chemical activation by KOH, at 800 °C and 1:1-impregnation ratio was advisable. The solid waste after the oil extraction was used to produce fuel pellet with a high measured heating value (22 MJ/kg). The study underlined spent coffee grounds as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. The residue offered not only a cut in raw material's cost, but also an increase in net profit through the commercialization of other value-Added by-products. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG) are an abundant by-product of the coffee industry with a complex composition that makes them a promising feedstock for a biorefinery. The objective of this study was to evaluate SCG as a substrate for combined chlorogenic acid and bioethanol production after dilute acid hydrolysis. The effect of phenolics extraction on the downstream process was evaluated exhibiting no loss of sugars and an increase in the sugar release efficiency during the dilute acid hydrolysis. In order to suggest an economically feasible process, phenolics extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis prior to ethanol fermentation were optimised by means of experimental design. The responses of the designs were not only the efficiencies of the processes, but also a balance between product recovery and estimated costs. In both cases, decreased efficiencies obtained with low liquid-solid ratios were countervailed by increased products concentrations and higher economical performance. Under the optimised conditions, the purity of the phenolics extract (32%) could allow it to enter the market as a dietary supplement of chlorogenic acid, a product with high trade value. Moreover, a concentration of 3.9% (w/v) ethanol was reached upon fermentation of the hydrolysate of SCG after extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Coffee is one of the most popular beverages (almost 9 million tons of coffee was consumed in 2014) and the second largest commodity traded worldwide. Coffee beans have long been used for human consumption, in the last centuries, producing coffee brews and instant coffee. About 50% of the coffee produced is directed for the production of soluble coffee generating spent coffee grounds (SCG) as a byproduct that is rich in carbohydrates, protein, lipids and bioactive molecules. SCG has found application as compost (soil conditioner), animal feed (poultry and ruminants), mushroom production, a substrate for fermentation (enzymes) and energy (biogas, liquid biofuel and bioelectricity). SCG composition and structure depends on the coffee beans used in the coffee production, as well as the industrial extraction process. The instant coffee manufacturing uses several hot water extraction steps with different temperature and its severity influences in the soluble solids extraction from the roasted beans and the characteristics of the generated SCG. The industrial process impacts on the amount of SCG generated and soluble compounds extraction, in average 4 kg of wet SCG per kilogram of instant coffee produced. Moreover, the structure of the remained polysaccharides in SCG, cellulose, galactomannan and arabinogalactan, can be more recalcitrant to further use. The SCG still contain extractable compounds (flavor and oil) in a lignocellulosic matrix formed by cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. These structural compounds are organized in the cell wall as a recalcitrant structure to the biological conversion process. Moreover, SCG is resistant to degradation and may need a pretreatment to make the material suitable for biotechnological conversion. The pretreatment disrupts the cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin structure, changing its properties and allowing a complex of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes breaking down polysaccharides into fermentable sugars. The factors responsible for SCG recalcitrance is related to its chemical composition, structural and physicochemical properties that influence the pretreatment response end requires a complex pool of enzymes to its hydrolysis. This review will focus on discuss the recalcitrance properties of the SCG, based on its composition and structural organization, and the complex enzyme necessary for its conversion, highlighting its impact on biotechnology and bioenergy process. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Spent coffee ground (SCG) contains large amounts of organic compounds (i.e. fatty acids, amino acids, polyphenols, minerals and polysaccharides) that justify its valorization. Earlier innovation explored the extraction of specific components such as oil, flavor, terpenes, and alcohols as value-added products. However, by-products of coffee fruit and bean processing can also be considered as potential functional ingredients for the food industry. There is an urgent need for practical and innovative ideas to use this low cost SCG and exploit its full potential increasing the overall sustainability of the coffee agro-industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Biodiesel is a renewable energy source produced from natural oils and fats, and is being used as a substitute for petroleum diesel. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and its by-products to produce pelletized fuel, which is expected to help the biodiesel production process achieve zero waste. For this experiment, spent coffee grounds sample was collected from Kaldis coffee, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Extraction of the spent coffee grounds oil was then conducted using n-hexane, ether and mixture of isopropanol to hexane ratio (50:50 %vol), and resulted in oil yield of 15.6, 17.5 and 21.5 %w/w respectively. A two-step process was used in biodiesel production with conversion of about 82 %w/w. The biodiesel quality parameters were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751). The major fatty acid compositions found by Gas chromatography were linoleic acid (37.6%), palmitic acid (39.8%), oleic (11.7%), and stearic acid (8.6%). In addition, solid waste remaining after oil extraction and glycerin ratio (glycerin content from 20-40%) was evaluated for fuel pellet (19.3-21.6 MJ/Kg) applications. Therefore, the results of this work could offer a new perspective to the production of biofuel from waste materials without growing plants and/or converting food to fuel. © 2014 BRTeam.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCG), a processing by-product from the coffee industry, were evaluated as a potential feedstock for preparing agropellets for energy production. Hence, pure SCG and a SCG/sawdust blend were transformed into pellets. The latter thermal and chemical properties such as calorific value, ash content, bulk density, fixed carbon and elemental analysis were obtained. Thermogravimetric analyses were conducted in order to determine pyrolysis kinetics and combustion characteristics in order to study the agropellets performance.The obtained results show that SCG pellets thermal characteristics are in the same order as conventional biomasses such as sawdust. Moreover, blend 50% SCG/50% sawdust reaches the superior NF agropellets standard requirements which are essential to sell this agropellets in the French market. Analysis of the thermal degradation shows that SCG and its blend follow the usual behavior of lignocellulosic materials. Comparison of the combustion characteristics shows a higher reactivity of the blend comparing to pure SCG and sawdust. Such behavior might relate to heterogeneous structure and mutual interaction of the individual components of SCG and sawdust. Pyrolysis kinetics parameters obtained for SCG and SCG/sawdust blend are fairly close agreement with those found in literature for different biomasses. Hence SCG/sawdust may be a promising biofuel for the energy production in industrial applications. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds is a byproduct from the soluble coffee company. Besides its use as animal feed or lipid source, it presents a high potential as biofuel. Whatever the application, to be useful, the product has to loose great part of its moisture content. The drying of spent coffee grounds in a cyclonic dryer was studied in the present work. Based on a experimental design, the effects of temperature of the air (Ta) (59 to 271 °C) and of the ratio mass flow rate of spent coffee grounds to mass flow rate of air (Wc/Wa) (0.1 to 3.6) on the moisture reduction (Mr) and average residence time of the particles on the cyclonic dryer (APRT) were studied. It was observed an inverse relation between Mr and the ratio Wc/Wa and a direct relation between Mr and Ta. Regarding the APRT, it presented an inverse relation to Wc/Wa. Additionally, the characterization of the spent coffee grounds was performed with respect to the centesimal composition, density and granulometric distribution. It was observed increasing the density and particle size with moisture increasing. It was shown that the cyclone could be an efficient dryer for particulate solids with the advantages of high moisture reduction within short residence time.},

They include biodiesel from used cooking oil and spent coffee grounds; chloromethyl furfural production from food wastes; and citrus peel utilization. The utilization of the byproducts as biorefinery feedstocks has the potential to address concerns about sustainability and food versus fuel simultaneously. Food waste byproducts are varied in nature and composition presenting a range of potential feedstocks for biorefineries based on the main building blocks of biomass. With a large food production industry and a strong research base in green chemistry, the UK is in a good position to take advantage of biorefinery feedstocks from food wastes.},

abstract={Defective green coffee (DGC), coffee silverskin (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG), three major byproducts of the coffee industry, were magnetically modified by treatment with an aqueous ferrofluid containing magnetite nanoparticles and characterized by SEM, XRD and FTIR. In order to assess their suitability as adsorbents for the removal of pollutants from wastewaters, adsorption and regeneration studies were carried out using methylene blue as a model contaminant. All the materials exhibited high adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate varied in the order: CS > SCG > DGC. In addition, their adsorption capacity remained almost unchanged for at least six adsorption/desorption cycles. These results strongly support their use as new low-cost adsorbents for environmental applications. © 2014, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={Data about coffee consumed world-wide are somewhat contradictory. A conservative estimate, suggests a number of around 8 mln tones per year. Its production involves a comparable amount of by-products, mainly pulp, husks, skins and spent coffee grounds. Thus, a sustainable coffee industry requires the development of methods for utilization of coffee by-products. Among these, the preparation of renewable fuel additives (e.g. biodiesel) and carbon adsorbents is a promising alternative to the eventual dumping of biogenic substances, harmful to the environment. Extraction of coffee by-products is the first step towards their utilization. This work presents results on laboratory extraction of spent coffee grounds (SCG) with different solvents, discussed in the context of the preparation of renewable fuel additives. The aim of the present study is to develop a procedure for extraction of coffee residues, suitable for production of biofuels and adsorbents.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are a significant residue produced annually worldwide. This by-product contains high levels of bioactive compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids that have recognized antioxidant properties. Recovery of these compounds previously for utilization in energy production is an interesting valorization approach, since they can be further incorporated in food products. A rapid, clean and reliable technique is required to discriminate SCG samples with high content of total phenolics, and total flavonoids as well as to assess their antioxidant capacity. In this work, Fourier-transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was used to determine the antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of several SCG samples (n=101). The antioxidant capacity of SCGs was determined by the ABTS assay, using the direct procedure that measures both soluble and insoluble antioxidant fractions and by the indirect approach that assesses the antioxidants present in SCG ethanolic extracts. FT-NIR spectra were calibrated against total flavonoid and total phenolic contents and the antioxidant capacity using PLS modeling. Spectral wavelength selection and latent variables were optimized for the lowest root mean square errors. All PLS models' results showed good linearity with an R2 for an independent test set of 0.93, 0.96, 0.95 and 0.95 for antioxidant capacity of SCGs, antioxidant capacity of SCG ethanolic extracts, and total flavonoid and total phenolic contents, respectively. The range error ratio (RER) was higher than 13 for all models (higher than 16 for three of them). Results confirmed that NIR spectroscopy is a promising technique for routine assessment of these parameters in SCGs and is a viable and advantageous alternative to chemical procedures involving laborious extractions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The coffee residue left after the preparation of the brew (spent coffee grounds - SCG) is very rich in polysaccharides, namely galactomannans and arabinogalactans, which are polymers that can be used as dietary fibre and present immunostimulatory activity. Considering the huge amount of SCG produced all over the world, the reutilisation of this by-product by its application as food ingredients is very promising. However, the yields of extraction of these polysaccharides tend to be very low, namely the galactomannans. Based on the observation that the yield of galactomannans extracted from the ground coffee to the brew increase when the coffee is roasted, in this study, with the aim of increasing the yield of these polysaccharides, the SCG was roasted and then extracted with hot water and alkali solutions. The roasting at 160 °C promoted an increment of 15% in the yield of galactomannan extractions and further improvement of the yield of extraction until 56% of all galactomannans was achieved by alkali extractions at 60 and 120 °C. In these samples the galactomannans still kept their characteristic structure, including the acetylation and branching, determined by sugar linkage analysis and mass spectrometry. The yield of extraction of arabinogalactans under these conditions was 54%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
