abstract={This paper presents an innovative application for spent coffee grounds (SCGs) used as filler for the formulation of lightweight clay ceramic aggregates (LWA). LWA can be used for urban and agricultural purposes as a sustainable solution. Spent coffee grounds were tested as a pore forming agent partially acting as a replacement for red clay in material formulation before firing. Substitutions of 10, 15, and 20 wt.% of red clay were tested. The properties of lightweight aggregates with 15 wt.% of SCGs were improved using a specifically tailored fertilizer glass due to its low pH and conductivity within the soil tolerance range. Packaging glassy sand, cattle-bone flour ash, and potassium carbonate were mixed and melted in order to obtain this glass, which when added to the clayey batch functionalized the aggregates by phosphorus and potassium nutrients. The results (in particular, porosity and bulk density) show that the lightweight aggregates obtained have interesting properties for possible uses both in urban (e.g., green roofs as a drainage layer) and agricultural purposes. Moreover, pH and conductivity are in line with the Italian Standard regarding soil amendment (D.lgs. 75/2010). In addition, several leaching tests were performed in a solution containing 2 vol.% citric acid (C6H8O7) to evaluate the release capacity not only of nutrients (P and K) but also to check the presence and release of heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), that may come from the glassy precursor. The results obtained showed that nutrients are efficiently released in 21 days (P = 87.73% and K = 25.74% of released percentage) and Pb release is under the standard threshold of 30 ppm. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Spent coffee grounds collected from coffee bars (SCG-1) or recovered from coffee capsules (SCG-2) were investigated as a potential source of phenolic compounds and energy. Preliminary characterization of these materials provided a total phenolic content of 17.75 mg GAE/g for SCG-1 and 21.56 mg GAE/g for SCG-2. A solvent-extraction procedure using aqueous ethanol as the solvent and operating under mild temperature conditions was developed and tested. A two-level factorial design was used to study the effects of temperature (T = 30-50 °C), extraction time (E = 60-120 min), liquid-to-solid ratio (R = 20-40 mL/g) and ethanol concentration in the aqueous mixture (C = 30-70 vol%) on the recovery of phenolic compounds. Under the best conditions, over 90% of the phenolic compounds contained in the starting waste materials were recovered. T, R and C were the most influential factors and all of them had a positive effect on the extraction efficiency. The calorific values of the two coffee wastes were 23.72 MJ/kg (SCG-1) and 24.07 MJ/kg (SCG-2). They were only marginally affected by the extraction procedure, which supports the possibility of integrating the recovery of phenolic compounds with the use of the resulting solid residue to produce pellets or other agglomerates for heating purposes. A case study application aimed at evaluating the potential valorization of the spent coffee produced in the Province of Rome is also presented. Copyright © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
