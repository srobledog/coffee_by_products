abstract={In the present study, biochar from spent coffee grounds was synthesized via pyrolysis at 850 °C for 1 h, characterized and employed as catalyst for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by persulfate activation. A variety of techniques, such as physisorption of N2, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X–ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and potentiometric mass titration, were employed for biochar characterization. The biochar has a surface area of 492 m2/g, its point of zero charge is 6.9, while mineral deposits are limited. SMX degradation experiments were performed mainly in ultrapure water (UPW) at persulfate concentrations between 100 and 1000 mg/L, biochar concentrations between 50 and 200 mg/L, SMX concentrations between 500 and 2000 μg/L and initial solution pH between 3 and 10. Real matrices, besides UPW, were also tested, namely bottled water (BW) and treated wastewater (WW), while synthetic solutions were prepared spiking UPW with bicarbonate, chloride, humic acid or alcohols. Almost complete removal of SMX can be achieved using 200 mg/L biochar and 1000 mg/L sodium persulfate (SPS) within 75 min. The presence of biochar is important for the degradation process, while the activity of the biochar increases linearly with SPS concentration. Degradation follows a pseudo–order kinetic model and the rate increases with increasing biochar concentration and decreasing SMX concentration. Although SMX adsorption onto the biochar surface is favored at acidic conditions, degradation proceeds equally fast regardless of the initial solution pH. Reactions in either real matrix are slower, resulting in 55% SMX removal in 60 min for WW. Bicarbonate causes severe inhibition as only 45% of SMX can be removed within 75 min in UPW. The addition of alcohol slightly inhibits degradation suggesting that the reaction pathway is either under electron transfer control or due to the generation of surface oxygen radicals with higher oxidation potential than the homogeneously produced radicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The agricultural industry generates large amounts of residues, commonly considered as waste. By-products from industrial processing of cacao, coffee and orange were used to formulate a dairy drink. The enriched dairy product was elaborated using a 10% aqueous extract of cocoa bean shells, coffee silverskin and orange peel. A design of mixtures of extreme vertices was applied to test the proportions of the ingredients of the aqueous extract. Sensorial characteristics like taste, odor, color and appearance were evaluated by a semi-trained testing panel applying the method of multiple comparisons, comparing the test formulations with a commercial drink of coffee and cocoa. The test formulations that were rated similar to the reference drink were selected to improve their total polyphenol content (TPC) applying a mathematical process of linear optimization. This approach indicated an optimal formulation containing 74 % cocoa bean shells, 24.50% coffee silverskin and 1.50% orange peel. This formulation gave TPC values of 5.74 ± 0.41 Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE) mg/g, 82.20 ± 0.08% antioxidant activity by the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and 114.78 mg/l caffeine content. The results demonstrate the feasibility to produce a drink enriched in antioxidant compounds retaining good sensorial attributes using industrial by products.},

abstract={Context: Currently, there is a great tendency in cosmetic area to use natural extracts. Coffee silverskin (CS) is the most abundant solid by-product generated during roasting of coffee processing. Objectives: To evaluate different CS extracts as promising cosmetic ingredients, regarding antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic properties. Materials and methods: Aqueous, hydroalcoholic and ethanolic CS extracts were obtained by an environmentally friendly procedure considering costs and pollution. Extracts were characterized for total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC, respectively), antioxidant activity by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), antimicrobial activity expressed as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and cytotoxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays in two skin cell lines (fibroblasts and keratinocytes). Results: The TPC of extracts was 18.33-35.25 mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of material on a dry basis (mg GAE/g db). The TFC of extracts was 1.08-2.47 μg cathechin equivalents per g dry material (μg CE/g db). The antioxidant activity was high, with values ranging between 95.95 and 216.40 μmol Fe2+/g for aqueous and alcoholic samples, respectively. Preliminary assays for antimicrobial potential showed that extracts display antibacterial activity. The MIC varied from 31.3 to 250 μg/mL for Gram-positive, and from 31.3 to 1000 μg/mL for Gram-negative. Extracts did not affect in vitro cell viability, with values near 100% in all concentrations tested. Conclusion: Results seem show that CS is a safe source of natural antioxidants with antifungal and antibacterial activity and no cytotoxicity, with potential usefulness for cosmetic applications. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={The present research aimed to add value to coffee silverskin by looking for new innovative applications. Formulation of novel beverages based on coffee silverskin for body fat reduction and body weight control was proposed. Conditions for beverage preparation were optimised. Data on chemical composition and sensorial quality of the new drink were acquired. Health benefits were evaluated in vitro and in vivo employing as animal model Caenorhabditis elegans. An antioxidant beverage containing physiological active concentrations of caffeine and chlorogenic acid for prevention body fat accumulation and possessing acceptable sensorial properties was obtained. Our findings support that the use of coffee silverskin for obtaining bioactive extract is an innovative way for revalorisation of coffee by-product. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
