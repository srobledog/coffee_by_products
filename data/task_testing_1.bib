abstract = {Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, thus being a rather relevant food commodity from an economic standpoint. In the coffee processing chain, from plant to cup, a series of by-products are generated in significant amounts with the major ones being husks, parchment husks, chaff (silverskin), and spent coffee ground (SCGs). Currently, these by-products are being underutilized in low-cost applications, e.g., ingredients for animal feed, substrate for composting and vermicomposting, and feedstock for in-farm or coffee industry combustion systems. The knowledge of the physical state and the chemical composition of each specific by-product is essential to define a path for its adequate exploitation. Coffee production and processing by-products present distinct physical and chemical characteristics, however, with a common distribution of classes of compounds among them, with carbohydrates comprising the major fraction, followed by proteins, lipids, ashes, polyphenols and caffeine. Thus, all the by-products are suitable for further profitable exploitation with current proposals for such valorization encompassing recovery of potential food ingredients, recovery and production of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, production of composite materials and films, production of adsorbents and catalysts, and production of biofuels. Thus, a critical overview of the current proposals is herein presented and future directions are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
